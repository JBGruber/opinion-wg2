# Relevance prediction

Exploring wether we can predict relevance of abstracts with SML.

- We tested BERT on CoLab
- However, performance of classical ML seems to be more than enough, potentially even better, especially with regard to Recall.
- We need very good recall, lower precision is less of an issue - we assume a human check afterwards anyway
