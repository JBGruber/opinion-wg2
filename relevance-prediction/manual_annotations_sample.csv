However, such opinions reflect different degrees of engagement which may affect the decisions in different forms. The aim of this study is to analyze the dimensions of online customer engagement and associated concepts (involvement, emotional states, experience and brand advocacy) in customers' online reviews through text-mining and sentiment analysis trends. The current study focuses on Yelp.com comments and includes a random sample of 15,000 unique reviews of restaurants, hotels and nightlife entertainment in eleven cities in the USA. A customer engagement dictionary is created, based on previously validated scales and extended using WordNet 2.1. The research findings reveal a high impact of the engagement cognitive processing dimension and hedonic experience on customers' review endeavor. Results further indicate that customers seem to be more engaged in positively advocating a company/brand than the contrary. Companies that listen to such feedback may be more able to align with consumers' expectations and, therefore, have a better competitive advantage in the market.",1

Nevertheless, the usual approaches for Opinion Mining are not able to deal with the characteristics and the challenges brought by continuous data streams; so, an alternative is the use of techniques such as Active Learning, which labels selected data rather than the entire data set. The Active Learning approach requires the choice of a sampling strategy to select the most valuable instances. However, no study has performed an analysis in order to identify the best strategies for Opinion Mining. In this sense, we evaluated eight Active Learning sampling strategies, from which Entropy achieved the best results. In addition, due to the lack of publicly available stream data sets written in Portuguese, we created and evaluated corpora from Twitter and Facebook about the 2018 Brazilian presidential elections.",1

There is an increased need for novel methods and tools that can provide information on the sentiments of crowds as an input for crowd management. Previous work has explored sentiment analysis and a large number of methods have been proposed relating to various contexts. None of them, however, aimed at deriving the sentiments of crowds using social media in city events, and no existing event-based dataset is available for such studies. This paper investigates how social media can be used to estimate the sentiments of crowds in city events. First, some lexicon-based and machine learning-based methods were selected to perform sentiment analyses, then an event-based sentiment annotated dataset was constructed. The performance of the selected methods was trained and tested in an experiment using common and event-based datasets. Results show that the machine learning method LinearSVC achieves the lowest estimation error for sentiment analysis on social media in city events. The proposed event-based dataset is essential for training methods to reduce estimation error in such contexts.",1

This shift has sparked a considerable amount of public discussion. This study aims to explore the online public's sentiment toward remote work amid the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: Based on justice theory, this paper examines user-generated content on social media platforms, particularly Twitter, to gain insight into public opinion and discourse surrounding remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Employing content analysis techniques such as sentiment analysis, text clustering and evolutionary analysis, this study aims to identify prevalent topics, temporal patterns and instances of sentiment polarization in tweets. Findings: Results show that people with positive opinions focus mainly on personal interests, while others focus on the interests of the company and society; people's subjectivities are higher when they express extremely negative or extremely positive emotions. Distributive justice and interactional justice are distinguishable with a high degree of differentiation in the cluster map. Originality/value: Previous research has inadequately addressed public apprehensions about remote work during emergencies, particularly from a justice-based perspective. This study seeks to fill this gap by examining how justice theory can shed light on the public's views regarding corporate policy-making during emergencies. The results of this study provide valuable insights and guidance for managing public opinion during such events. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",1

The language used by the users in social media earlier was purely English. Code-mixed text, i.e., mixing of two or more languages, is commonly seen now. In code-mixed data, one language will be written using another language script. So to process such code-mixed text, identification of language used in each word is important for language processing. The main objective of the work is to propose a technique for identifying the language of Hindi-English code-mixed data used in three social media platforms namely, Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp. The classification of Hindi-English code-mixed data into Hindi, English, Named Entity, Acronym, Universal, Mixed (Hindi along with English) and Undefined tags were performed. Popular word embedding features were used for the representation of each word. Two kinds of embedding features were considered - word-based embedding features and character-based context features. The proposed method was done with the addition of context information along with the embedding features. A well-known machine learning classifier, Support Vector Machine was used to train and test the system. The work on Language Identification in code-mixed text using character-based embedding is a novel approach and shows promising results.",0

The major process of TSA is to determine the sentiment or polarity of the tweet and then classifying them into a negative or positive tweet. There are several methods introduced for carrying out TSA, however, it remains to be challenging due to slang words, modern accents, grammatical and spelling mistakes, and other issues that could not be solved by existing techniques. This work develops a novel customized BERT-oriented sentiment classification that encompasses two main phases: pre-processing and tokenization, and a Customized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based classification. At first, the gathered raw tweets are pre-processed under stop-word removal, stemming and blank space removal. After pre-processing, the semantic words are obtained, from which the meaningful words (tokens) are extracted in the tokenization phase. Consequently, these extracted tokens are classified via optimized BERT, where biases and weight are tuned optimally by Particle-Assisted Circle Updating Position (PA-CUP). Moreover, the maximal sequence length of the BERT encoder is updated using standard PA-CUP. Finally, the performance analysis is carried out to substantiate the enhancement of the proposed model.",0

The assessments of Karl Leonhard, which reflected a whole period both in the history of reception of the work of the Dutch artist in the then divided Germany, and in the history of German medicine, are the result of a dialogue between the Dutch art culture and the culture of German nosological psychiatry, inscribed in the history of the medical discourse of that period and pathographic art history. Leonhard made a significant contribution to the study and description of the clinical manifestations of endogenous psychoses. Clinical experience leads the German psychiatrist to conclude that the diagnosis of schizophrenia, which the Russian school is inclined to support, and that of epilepsy are wrong, because the artist suffered from anxiety-happiness psychosis, which is a special form of cycloid psychosis. The evidence-based method used by Leonhard is close to the traditions of Russian humanistic psychiatry. Despite the fact that Leonhard's positivist-oriented nosological approach is currently being criticized by adherents of the psychoanalytic approach in psychiatry, it should be noted that there is no objective evidence that one approach excludes the other: in our opinion, they complement each other. Studying van Gogh's letters, the testimonies of his contemporaries, and taking into account the data of later works on van Gogh, the authors of this paper reproduce the picture of the symptoms of a mental illness, emphasizing the importance of the expansive and carefully thought-out classification of Leonhard's endogenous psychoses and focusing on the evidence of fluctuations in the artist's affect and disturbances of the process of perception, his attitude to his own illness from the point of view of psychiatry and clinical psychology. In addition, the paper provides an overview of the latest pathographic studies of van Gogh and their critical analysis. In conclusion, the authors of the paper announce the publication of the full text of Leonhard's essay in Russian translation accompanied by commentary by art critics and medical scholars.",0

Social media posts contain a lot of sarcastic statements that affect the automatic extraction of the correct sentiment of the post, as sarcasm can flip the overall polarity of the sentence. Sarcasm is a bitterly cutting form of irony to be unpleasant to somebody or to make fun of them. Therefore, identifying sarcastic statements from the users' posts has become an important task to extract the actual sentiments from informal statements regarding an event or a person. In this work, we propose a hybrid attention-based Long Short Term Memory (HA-LSTM) network to identify sarcastic statements. This HA-LSTM network is different than the existing LSTM model, as the proposed HA-LSTM network combines 16 different linguistic features in their hidden layers. The proposed HA-LSTM network is validated with three benchmark datasets. The combination of 16 different linguistic features shows an improvement in the performance of the model in comparison with other state-of-the-art models with an improvement of up to 2% in terms of F-1-score with three different gold standard datasets.

It is a subtask of sentiment analysis that is used to identify text sentiment orientation towards different aspects of a mobile phone such as camera and screen resolution. During the last decade, research community focused on identifying and extracting aspects like the most common methods used for aspect extraction to identify the main features of an entity only. These techniques are corpus or lexicon based and domain specific. Some approaches for aspect extraction are based on term frequency and inverse document frequency. Such approaches are quite good if aspects are associated with predefined categories and may fail if low-frequency aspects are concerned. The heuristic-based approaches are better than frequency and lexicon-based approaches in terms of accuracy, but due to the different combinations of features, they consumed time. The researchers have already implemented machine learning techniques to analyse sentiments present in the given document. But, execution time for these techniques increases due to the increasing aspects in a set of data. Also, irrelevant and redundant aspects participate in determining the sentiment of the given document, thereby varying the accuracy of the algorithm. In this research, we present a segregational approach for aspect identification that is based on aspect and opinion words disentangling and aspect refinement using concept similarity. To obtain better accuracy, we also built a set of part of speech tagger and integrated it with our proposed technique. The experimental analysis reveals that our proposed technique outperforms the existing counterparts.",1

One way to find novel ideas is to transfer uncommon features of products of other domains and integrate them into the product to be improved. However, before incorporating such targeted features into the product, they need to be evaluated against the customers' acceptance in social media using sentiment aggregation tools. Despite the many studies in sentiment analysis, mapping the customers' opinions towards both high-level and technical features of a product extracted from social media to their best corresponding component in that product is still a challenge. Furthermore, none of the existing approaches ascertains the sentiment value of a targeted feature by capturing its dependencies on other features. In this paper, to address these drawbacks, we propose the sentiment aggregation framework for targeted features (SA-TF). SA-TF determines the sentiment of a targeted feature by assisting product designers in the tasks of mapping the features discussed in the reviews to the right product components, sentiment aggregation and considering feature dependencies to determine their polarity. The superiority of the different phases of SA-TF is demonstrated with experiments and comparing it with an existing approach.",1

However, collecting and managing customers' opinions on different social media platforms is a complicated and challenging task. The customers express their opinions in their colloquial language that contains spelling errors and repetition of letters, so the preprocessing stage solves these problems and enhances the quality of data to become ready to conduct sentiment polarity and calculate reputation scores. In this paper, the Saudi customers' tweets are collected for four restaurants in Madinah. The Polarity Lexicon for the Saudi dialect (PLSD) and Emoji Lexicon for Sentiment Analysis (ELSA) are developed as a core component in our system to classify the extracted tweets into positive, negative, and neutral. Next, the Net Brand Reputation (NBR) is used to derive the reputation score from the lexicon feedback. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the results from the proposed approach were compatible with the results extracted from Foursquare, an application that measures restaurants' reputations based on customer ratings and comments.",1

Sentiment analysis is a computational method that plays an essential role in automating the extraction of subjective information i.e. customer's sentiment or opinion from online product reviews. Two approaches commonly used in Sentiment analysis tasks are supervised approaches and lexicon-based approaches. In supervised approaches, Sentiment analysis is seen as a text classification task. The result depends not only on the robustness of the machine learning algorithm but also on the utilized features. Bag-of-word is a common utilized features. As a statistical feature, bag-of-word does not take into account semantic of words. Previous research has indicated the potential of semantic in supervised SA task. To augment the result of sentiment analysis, this paper proposes a method to extract text features named sentence level features (SLF) and domain sensitive features (DSF) which take into account semantic of words in both sentence level and domain level of product reviews. A word sense disambiguation based method was adapted to extract SLF. For every similarity employed in generating SLF, the SentiCircle-based method was enhanced to generate DSF. Results of the experiments indicated that our proposed semantic features i.e. SLF and SLF+DSF favorably increase the performance of supervised sentiment analysis on product reviews.",1

As online markets have become more popular over the past decades, online retailers and merchants are asking their buyers to share their opinions about the products they have purchased. As a result, millions of reviews are generated daily, making it difficult to make a good decision about whether a consumer should buy a product. Analyzing these enormous concepts is difficult and time-consuming for product manufacturers. Deep learning is the current research interest in Natural language processing. In the proposed model, Skip-gram architecture is used for better feature extraction of semantic and contextual information of words. LSTM (long short-term memory) is used in the proposed model for understanding complex patterns in textual data. To improve the performance of the LSTM, weight parameters are optimized by the adaptive particle Swarm Optimization algorithm.

Numerous studies have assessed the agenda-setting patterns of the news or social media. However, few have compared them regarding the level of the prolonged exposure these media provide to specific topics (which is essential for agenda-setting). Moreover, there is a lack of study on system frameworks with experimented mechanisms to realize the comparison. As a result, this research aims to compare the agenda-setting patterns of the news and social media in terms of the prolonged exposure these media provide to specific topics and simultaneously propose a framework based on the processes and analysis techniques used in this research. The framework offers an end-to-end solution to compare the agenda-setting patterns between the news and social media and comprises of a total of three analysis techniques: Trailing Moving Average, Cosine Similarity, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The results of this research discover that the news media is more sticky in their topic coverage tends to be preceded/succeeded by gradual increases/decreases in coverage.

Sentiment Analysis on web data is now becoming a budding research area of social analytics. Users express their sentiments on the web by exchanging texts and uploading images through a variety of social media like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp etc. A lot of research work has been done for sentiment analysis of textual data; there has been limited work that focuses on analyzing the sentiment of image data. Image sentiment concepts are ANPs i.e. Adjective Noun Pairs automatically discovered tags of web images which are useful for detecting the emotions or sentiments conveyed by the image. The major challenge is to predict or identify the sentiments of unlabelled images. To overcome this challenge deep learning techniques are used for sentiment analysis, as deep learning models have the capability for effectively learning the image behavior or polarity. Image recognition, image prediction, image sentiment analysis, and image classification are some of the fields where Neural Network (NN) has performed well implying significant performance of deep learning in image sentiment analysis.

Vinila",2022,"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS","Article","Opinion mining is a natural language processing based on sentiment classification technique to determine the sentiment of the reviews. The major existing text Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms are derived based on 3 x 3 size kernels which extract ineffective review text-features and lead to less classification accuracy. Moreover, most of the traditional CNN versions output three classes such as positive, negative, and neutral as their classification results. Hence, a novel algorithm namely 'RAVO driven Multi-Size Kernel structured Text CNN for classifying ecommerce reviews (MSK-TCNN-RAVO)' is proposed in this work. This proposed approach utilizes five multi-size kernels (3 x 7,5 x 7,1 x 3,1 x 5,1 x 7), multi-dimensional kernels (1D & 2D), and integrates varying size kernels to extract text-features effectively. In addition, the performance of multi-kernel CNN is highly enhanced by RAVO algorithm based on rider optimization. Moreover, the proposed approach is highly effective to process 'review-stop-words removal' that decrease the complexity and time consumption of the opinion mining process. Most existing systems use single pooling operations which reduce feature map processing performance, hence, dual pooling operations (both Max and Average pooling) are employed in this research. Furthermore, it is configured to generate five classification outputs such as bad, fair, neutral, good, and excellent to support better decision-making with 95.5% accuracy. This method is evaluated using different quality metrics and five review-databases to measure the performance, and the results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the other existing review classification algorithms.",1

Recent research has however not been able to combine these two in a way that instils flexibility into the iterative process of textual analysis for decision making. In this work, the Opinion and Context-Aware Inverted Index graph model is proposed for performing sentiment search and analysis on textual data. Unlike previous works, the use of the proposed model retrieves needed information without requiring re-processing of sentiment information. The proposed approach clarifies the difference between sentiment search and sentiment categorization. Furthermore, it shows how to perform opinion aware search based on graph traversals, pattern matching and aspect opinion filtering. To evaluate the flexibility and capabilities of the proposed scheme, the feature interest range, customer feature satisfaction/dissatisfaction intensity, feature co-mentions, and sentiment based ranking metrics of various bipartite projections for feature co-mention sub graphs using PageRank are extracted from a well-studied dataset on online product reviews with an extension of the proposed model. The chosen design and methodology is shown to be suitable for big data scale implementations.",1

Existing approaches focus on solving explicit sentiment, but struggle with analyzing implicit sentiment reviews. In this paper, to address the issue, we propose SI-TS, a framework that takes implicit sentiment extraction into account. Specifically, we design target structure (TS) to capture implicit sentiment by converting sentiment elements into a structured format. Furthermore, to adaptively generate appropriate TS according to different sentiment scenarios, we design an prompt template based sentiment instructor(SI). It assists the framework in effectively extracting implicit sentiment elements from the reviews. Extensive experiments were conducted on two widely used ACOS benchmarks, and improvements in F1 values were observed. Specifically, we achieved a 1.05% and 1.28% improvement in F1 values for Laptop-ACOS and Restaurant-ACOS, respectively. Notably, significant results were achieved in extracting implicit sentiment. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",1

"15302","Information Extraction and Named Entity Recognition Supported Social Media Sentiment Analysis during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Nemes, Laszlo; Kiss, Attila",2021,"APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL","Article","Social media platforms are increasingly being used to communicate information, something which has only intensified during the pandemic. News portals and governments are also increasing attention to digital communications, announcements and response or reaction monitoring. Twitter, as one of the largest social networking sites, which has become even more important in the communication of information during the pandemic, provides space for a lot of different opinions and news, with many discussions as well. In this paper, we look at the sentiments of people and we use tweets to determine how people have related to COVID-19 over a given period of time. These sentiment analyses are augmented with information extraction and named entity recognition to get an even more comprehensive picture. The sentiment analysis is based on the 'Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers' (BERT) model, which is the basic measurement model for the comparisons. We consider BERT as the baseline and compare the results with the RNN, NLTK and TextBlob sentiment analyses. The RNN results are significantly closer to the benchmark results given by BERT, both models are able to categorize all tweets without a single tweet fall into the neutral category. Then, via a deeper analysis of these results, we can get an even more concise picture of people's emotional state in the given period of time. The data from these analyses further support the emotional categories, and provide a deeper understanding that can provide a solid starting point for other disciplines as well, such as linguistics or psychology. Thus, the sentiment analysis, supplemented with information extraction and named entity recognition analyses, can provide a supported and deeply explored picture of specific sentiment categories and user attitudes.",1

However, an individual's position on a controversial issue is often not just a binary support-or-oppose stance on the issue, but rather a conglomerate of nuanced opinions and beliefs on various aspects of the issue. These opinions and beliefs are often expressed qualitatively in free text in issue-focused surveys or on social media. However, quantifying vast amounts of qualitative information remains a significant challenge. The goal of this work is to provide a new approach for quantifying qualitative data for the understanding of controversial issues. First, we show how we can engage people directly through crowdsourcing to create a comprehensive dataset of assertions (claims, opinions, arguments, etc.) relevant to an issue. Next, the assertions are judged for agreement and strength of support or opposition, again by crowdsourcing. The collected Dataset of Nuanced Assertions on Controversial Issues (NAoCI dataset) consists of over 2,000 assertions on sixteen different controversial issues. It has over 100,000 judgments of whether people agree or disagree with the assertions, and of about 70,000 judgments indicating how strongly people support or oppose the assertions. This dataset allows for several useful analyses that help summarize public opinion. Across the sixteen issues, we find that when people judge a large set of assertions they often do not disagree with the individual assertions that the opposite side makes, but that they differently judge the relative importance of these assertions. We show how assertions that cause dissent or consensus can be identified by ranking the whole set of assertions based on the collected judgments. We also show how free-text assertions in social media can be analyzed in conjunction with the crowdsourced information to quantify and summarize public opinion on controversial issues.",1
"14419","Automatic construction of target-specific sentiment lexicon","Wu, Sixing; Wu, Fangzhao; Chang, Yue; Wu, Chuhan; Huang, Yongfeng",2019,"EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS","Article","Sentiment lexicon plays an important role in sentiment analysis system. In most existing sentiment lexica, each sentiment word or phrase is given a sentiment label or score. However, a sentiment word may express different sentiment orientations describing different targets. It's beneficial but challenging to incorporate knowledge of opinion targets into sentiment lexicon. In this paper we propose an automatic approach to construct a target-specific sentiment lexicon, in which each term is an opinion pair consisting of an opinion target and an opinion word. The approach solves two principle problems in construction process, namely, opinion target extraction and opinion pair sentiment classification. An unsupervised algorithm is proposed to extract opinion pairs in high quality. Both semantic feature and syntactic feature are incorporated in the algorithm, to extract opinion pairs containing correct opinion targets. A group of opinion pairs are generated and a framework is proposed to classify their sentiment polarities. Knowledge of available resources including general-purpose sentiment lexicon and thesaurus, and context knowledge including syntactic relations and sentiment information in sentences, are extracted and integrated in a unified framework to calculate sentiment scores of opinion pairs. Experimental results on product reviews datasets in different domains prove the effectiveness of our method in target-specific sentiment lexicon construction, which can improve performances of opinion target extraction and opinion pair sentiment classification. In addition, our lexicon also achieves better performance in target-level sentiment classification compared with several general-purpose sentiment lexicons. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Social media such as Twitter provide an unprecedented way for the prompt assessment of the large-scale public response. Objective: The aims of this study were to develop a scheme for a comprehensive public perception analysis of a measles outbreak based on Twitter data and demonstrate the superiority of the convolutional neural network (CNN) models (compared with conventional machine learning methods) on measles outbreak-related tweets classification tasks with a relatively small and highly unbalanced gold standard training set. Methods: We first designed a comprehensive scheme for the analysis of public perception of measles based on tweets, including 3 dimensions: discussion themes, emotions expressed, and attitude toward vaccination. All 1,154,156 tweets containing the word measles posted between December 1, 2014, and April 30, 2015, were purchased and downloaded from DiscoverText. com. Two expert annotators curated a gold standard of 1151 tweets (approximately 0.1% of all tweets) based on the 3-dimensional scheme. Next, a tweet classification system based on the CNN framework was developed. We compared the performance of the CNN models to those of 4 conventional machine learning models and another neural network model. We also compared the impact of different word embeddings configurations for the CNN models: (1) Stanford GloVe embedding trained on billions of tweets in the general domain, (2) measles-specific embedding trained on our 1 million measles related tweets, and (3) a combination of the 2 embeddings. Results: Cohen kappa intercoder reliability values for the annotation were: 0.78, 0.72, and 0.80 on the 3 dimensions, respectively. Class distributions within the gold standard were highly unbalanced for all dimensions. The CNN models performed better on all classification tasks than k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, support vector machines, or random forest. Detailed comparison between support vector machines and the CNN models showed that the major contributor to the overall superiority of the CNN models is the improvement on recall, especially for classes with low occurrence. The CNN model with the 2 embedding combination led to better performance on discussion themes and emotions expressed (microaveraging F1 scores of 0.7811 and 0.8592, respectively), while the CNN model with Stanford embedding achieved best performance on attitude toward vaccination (microaveraging F1 score of 0.8642). Conclusions: The proposed scheme can successfully classify the public's opinions and emotions in multiple dimensions, which would facilitate the timely understanding of public perceptions during the outbreak of an infectious disease. Compared with conventional machine learning methods, our CNN models showed superiority on measles-related tweet classification tasks with a relatively small and highly unbalanced gold standard. With the success of these tasks, our proposed scheme and CNN-based tweets classification system is expected to be useful for the analysis of tweets about other infectious diseases such as influenza and Ebola.",1

Of all the management disciplines, the employment trend in the field of accounting best reflects the state of recruitment of professionals. Thus, we need to examine what each profession expects from accountants. Using text analysis via Wordstat, we analyze 7,320 pre-accounting job advertisements to find the overall job specification of the sector for a pre-accounting employee. Of the 25 criteria identified, 12 were found common in the literature, local standards, and the sector. From our findings, the Turkish sector is more adapted to international than local standards, indicating that local standards were set without consulting the employers. This study further confirms that soft skills are as important as technical skills. Additionally, women are more likely to be recruited to a pre-accountant position during their 10-year study period. Turkey is a Eurasian country that is influenced by both Asian and European countries and their respective profession-related norms and practices. Thus, our findings may be generalizable.

In recent years, a large and growing body of literature has investigated the extraction of customer requirements and preferences from online reviews. However, since customer requirements change dynamically over time, traditional studies failed to obtain the change data of customer requirements and opinions based on sentiments expressed in reviews. In this paper, a new method for dynamically mining user requirements is proposed, which is used to analyze the changing behavior of product attributes and improve product design. Dynamic mining differs from the traditional need acquisition mainly in three aspects: (1) it involves dynamically mining user requirements over time (2) it adds changes in manufacturers' opinions to the analysis (3) it allows for product improvement strategies based on the changing behavior of product attributes. First, text mining is adopted to collect customer and manufacturer review data for different time periods and extract product attributes. A Natural Language Processing tool is used to measure the importance weight and sentiment score of product attributes. Second, an approach for dynamically mining user requirements is introduced to classify product attributes and analyze the changes of attribute data in three categories over time. Finally, an improvement strategy for next-generation product design is developed based on the changing behavior of attributes. Moreover, a case study on vehicles based on online reviews was conducted to illustrate the proposed methodology. Our research suggests that the proposed approach can accurately mine customer requirements and lead to successful product improvement strategies for next-generation products.",1

Diaz; Kayed, Mohammed",2021,"SENSORS","Article","Recently, it has been found that e-commerce (EC) websites provide a large amount of useful information that exceed the human cognitive processing capacity. In order to help customers in comparing alternatives when buying a product, previous research authors have designed opinion summarization systems based on customer reviews. They ignored the template information provided by manufacturers, although its descriptive information has the most useful product characteristics and texts are linguistically correct, unlike reviews. Therefore, this paper proposes a methodology coined as SEOpinion (summarization and exploration of opinions) to summarize aspects and spot opinion(s) regarding them using a combination of template information with customer reviews in two main phases. First, the hierarchical aspect extraction (HAE) phase creates a hierarchy of aspects from the template. Subsequently, the hierarchical aspect-based opinion summarization (HAOS) phase enriches this hierarchy with customers' opinions to be shown to other potential buyers. To test the feasibility of using deep learning-based BERT techniques with our approach, we created a corpus by gathering information from the top five EC websites for laptops. The experimental results showed that recurrent neural network (RNN) achieved better results (77.4% and 82.6% in terms of F1-measure for the first and second phases, respectively) than the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the support vector machine (SVM) technique.",1

SOCC is part of a project that investigates the linguistic characteristics of online comments. The corpus can be used to study a host of pragmatic phenomena. Among other aspects, researchers can explore: the connections between articles and comments; the connections of comments to each other; the types of topics discussed in comments; the nice (constructive) or mean (toxic) ways in which commenters respond to each other; how language is used to convey very specific types of evaluation; and how negation affects the interpretation of evaluative meaning in discourse. Our current focus is the study of constructiveness and evaluation in the comments. To that end, we have annotated a subset of the large corpus (1043 comments) with four layers of annotations: constructiveness, toxicity, negation and Appraisal (Martin and White, The language of evaluation, Palgrave, New York, 2005). This paper details our corpus, the data collection process, the characteristics of the corpus and describes the annotations. While our focus is comments posted in response to opinion news articles, the phenomena in this corpus are likely to be present in many commenting platforms: other news comments, comments and replies in fora such as Reddit, feedback on blogs, or YouTube comments.",0

The presented article uses Twitter posts to better understand public opinion regarding the vegan (plant-based) diet that has traditionally been portrayed negatively on social media. However, in recent years, studies on health benefits, COVID-19, and global warming have increased the awareness of plant-based diets. The study employs a dataset derived from a collection of vegan-related tweets and uses a sentiment analysis technique for identifying the emotions represented in them. The purpose of sentiment analysis is to determine whether a piece of text (tweet in our case) conveys a negative or positive viewpoint. We use the mutual information approach to perform feature selection in this study. We chose this method because it is suitable for mining the complicated features from vegan tweets and extracting users' feelings and emotions. The results revealed that the vegan diet is becoming more popular and is currently framed more positively than in previous years. However, the emotions of fear were mostly strong throughout the period, which is in sharp contrast to other types of emotions. Our findings place new information in the public domain, which has significant implications. The article provides evidence that the vegan trend is growing and new insights into the key emotions associated with this growth from 2010 to 2022. By gaining a deeper understanding of the public perception of veganism, medical experts can create appropriate health programs and encourage more people to stick to a healthy vegan diet. These results can be used to devise appropriate government action plans to promote healthy veganism and reduce the associated emotion of fear.",1

Nowadays, as new reviews are posted daily on social media, there may be value in using web opinions to improve the performance of stock price prediction. To this end, we use logistic regression to screen the chip indicators and establish a basic stock price prediction model. Then, we employ text mining technology to quantify the unstructured data of social media opinions on stock-related news into sentiment scores, which are found to correlate significantly with the change extent of the stock price. Based on the findings that the higher the sentiment scores, the lower the prediction accuracy of the logistic regression model, we propose an improved prediction approach that integrates sentiment scores into the logistic regression model. Our results show that the proposed model can improve the prediction accuracy for stock prices, and can thus provide a new reference for investment strategies for stock investors.",1

What roles do they play in this process in an emotion-discouraging context? In this exploratory study, we examine networked patterns of anger diffusion within the Red-Yellow-Blue kindergarten child abuse scandal on the Chinese social media Weibo. Using supervised machine learning for emotion labeling and a social network analysis approach, we identified three types of actors and profiled their distinctive roles in the process of anger contagion. Broadcasters (e.g., verified organization accounts) act as both an information source and a legitimate source to elicit other users' emotion through emotion-free information. Furthermore, emotion initiators like celebrities instigate and lead other users' emotions, while emotion brokers like micro-celebrities build bridges between different subgroups to form a massive-scale network of emotion contagion. These actors are indispensable and complement each other for emotion contagion in China. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings on the understanding of emotion diffusion in online activism.",0

Most methods focus on effectively extracting the sentimental features of images, such as enhancing local features through saliency detection or instance segmentation tools. However, as a high-level abstraction, the sentiment is difficult to accurately capture with the visual element because of the affective gap. Previous works have overlooked the contribution of the interaction among objects to the image sentiment. We aim to utilize interactive characteristics of objects in the sentimental space, inspired by human sentimental principles that each object contributes to the sentiment. To achieve this goal, we propose a framework to leverage the sentimental interaction characteristic based on a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). We first utilize an off-the-shelf tool to recognize objects and build a graph over them. Visual features represent nodes, and the emotional distances between objects act as edges. Then, we employ GCNs to obtain the interaction features among objects, which are fused with the CNN output of the whole image to predict the final results. Experimental results show that our method exceeds the state-of-the-art algorithm. Demonstrating that the rational use of interaction features can improve performance for sentiment analysis.",0

"17224","Mention effect in information diffusion on a micro-blogging network","Bao, Peng; Shen, Hua-Wei; Huang, Junming; Chen, Haiqiang",2018,"PLOS ONE","Article","Micro-blogging systems have become one of the most important ways for information sharing. Network structure and users' interactions such as forwarding behaviors have aroused considerable research attention, while mention, as a key feature in micro-blogging platforms which can improve the visibility of a message and direct it to a particular user beyond the underlying social structure, is seldom studied in previous works. In this paper, we empirically study the mention effect in information diffusion, using the dataset from a population-scale social media website. We find that users with high number of followers would receive much more mentions than others. We further investigate the effect of mention in information diffusion by examining the response probability with respect to the number of mentions in a message and observe a saturation at around 5 mentions. Furthermore, we find that the response probability is the highest when a reciprocal followship exists between users, and one is more likely to receive a target user's response if they have similar social status. To illustrate these findings, we propose the response prediction task and formulate it as a binary classification problem. Extensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of discovered factors. Our results have consequences for the understanding of human dynamics on the social network, and potential implications for viral marketing and public opinion monitoring.",0

"14413","A Topic Recognition Method of News Text Based on Word Embedding Enhancement","Du, Qiming; Li, Nan; Liu, Wenfu; Sun, Daozhu; Yang, Shudan; Yue, Feng",2022,"COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE","Article","Topic recognition technology has been commonly applied to identify different categories of news topics from the vast amount of web information, which has a wide application prospect in the field of online public opinion monitoring, news recommendation, and so on. However, it is very challenging to effectively utilize key feature information such as syntax and semantics in the text to improve topic recognition accuracy. Some researchers proposed to combine the topic model with the word embedding model, whose results had shown that this approach could enrich text representation and benefit natural language processing downstream tasks. However, for the topic recognition problem of news texts, there is currently no standard way of combining topic model and word embedding model. Besides, some existing similar approaches were more complex and did not consider the fusion between topic distribution of different granularity and word embedding information. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel text representation method based on word embedding enhancement and further forms a full-process topic recognition framework for news text. In contrast to traditional topic recognition methods, this framework is designed to use the probabilistic topic model LDA, the word embedding models Word2vec and Glove to fully extract and integrate the topic distribution, semantic knowledge, and syntactic relationship of the text, and then use popular classifiers to automatically recognize the topic categories of news based on the obtained text representation vectors. As a result, the proposed framework can take advantage of the relationship between document and topic and the context information, which improves the expressive ability and reduces the dimensionality. Based on the two benchmark datasets of 20NewsGroup and BBC News, the experimental results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method based on word embedding enhancement for the news topic recognition problem.",0

Impression Management Theory (IMT) and Social Presence Theory (SPT) have been utilized to analyze the imposition of the decision to practice self-censorship to sports fans, spectators, and athletes for sharing Winter Olympics content over social media channels other than Weibo. A total of 3270 tweets were collected using the combination of a keyword and a hashtag “Weibo” and “#Beijing2022”. The findings suggest that Twitter users chose to remain vocal against the ban and disregarded the idea of self-censorship, as advised by Weibo. The results of sentiment analysis show overall positive polarity. After the warning from Weibo, the polarity peaked towards the negative value, and emotions such as anger, anticipation, fear, and surprise were observed. Despite a warning from Weibo, sports fans shared Winter Olympics content on Twitter, and a few links were blocked.

Challenging cases benefit from additional opinions of pathologist colleagues. In addition to on-site colleagues, there is an active worldwide community of pathologists on social media for complementary opinions. Such access to pathologists worldwide has the capacity to improve diagnostic accuracy and generate broader consensus on next steps in patient care. From Twitter we curate 13,626 images from 6,351 tweets from 25 pathologists from 13 countries. We supplement the Twitter data with 113,161 images from 1,074,484 PubMed articles. We develop machine learning and deep learning models to (i) accurately identify histopathology stains, (ii) discriminate between tissues, and (iii) differentiate disease states. Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) is 0.805-0.996 for these tasks. We repurpose the disease classifier to search for similar disease states given an image and clinical covariates. We report precision@k = 1 = 0.7618 +/- 0.0018 (chance 0.397 +/- 0.004, mean +/- stdev ). The classifiers find that texture and tissue are important clinico-visual features of disease. Deep features trained only on natural images (e.g., cats and dogs) substantially improved search performance, while pathology-specific deep features and cell nuclei features further improved search to a lesser extent. We implement a social media bot (@pathobot on Twitter) to use the trained classifiers to aid pathologists in obtaining real-time feedback on challenging cases. If a social media post containing pathology text and images mentions the bot, the bot generates quantitative predictions of disease state (normal/artifact/infection/injury/nontumor, preneoplastic/benign/low-grade-malignant-potential, or malignant) and lists similar cases across social media and PubMed. Our project has become a globally distributed expert system that facilitates pathological diagnosis and brings expertise to underserved regions or hospitals with less expertise in a particular disease. This is the first pan-tissue pan-disease (i.e., from infection to malignancy) method for prediction and search on social media, and the first pathology study prospectively tested in public on social media.

To foster sustainable development, Brazilian farming students have to learn about land use according to the Sustainable Development Goals and how to implement them on their home farm and future workplace. Through a questionnaire -based survey, our study explored the perceptions of 128 students at the Family Farming High School of Porto Nacional on the sustainability of farming systems in the Cerrado of Tocantins. We analyzed the effectiveness of the school in teaching sustainability, the students' occupational preferences and perspectives, and their sentiment about three common farming systems in the Cerrado of Tocantins, i.e., agribusiness, family farming, and agroecological farming, and their opinion on the business relationships among the three systems. Even though our study confirmed the effectiveness of school-work alternation models in transferring sustainability practices from school to home farms, it also revealed farming students' poor understanding of the systemic definition of sustainability. Students defined sustainable and unsustainable farms with different perspectives and evaluation criteria, most of them referring to environmental indicators such as the way materials are used, whether the natural environment is protected, and whether biodiversity is preserved on the farm. There is a discrepancy between students' occupational preference and their prevalent sentiment about family farming, agribusiness, and agroecological farming. While more than half of them would accept to work on an agribusiness farm, significantly more students have a positive sentiment in favor of family farming and agroecological farming than agribusiness farming. The three farming systems, however, are not perceived as contending or isolated but as partnering businesses, featuring low competition and high cooperation rates. Our study contributes to a broader appreciation of the Brazilian students' perception of farming sustainability in the Cerrado of Tocantins and helps environmental education programs improve their effectiveness in transferring sustainability.",0

Building on the work of James Bryce, Lindsay Rogers, Herbert Blumer, Paul Lazarsfeld, and more, this essay revisits the discipline's historical roots and draws parallels between past theory and present practice. Today, scholars treat public opinion as the summation of individual attitudes, weighted equally and expressed anonymously at static points in time through polls, yet prior to the advent of survey research, it was conceived as something intrinsically social and dynamic. In an era dominated by online discussion boards and social media platforms, the insights of this earlier classical tradition offer two pathways forward. First, for those who criticize computational social science as poorly theorized, it provides a strong justification for the work that data scientists do in text mining and sentiment analysis. And second, it offers clues for how emerging technologies might be leveraged effectively for the study of public opinion in the future.",0

However, NB assumes that each feature does not have dependencies with others, which may not be fulfilled in text analysis. To reduce the effect of this assumption, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used as a feature weighting process. Features that are highly correlated with the class label and lowly correlated with other features are given more weights.

Method: Online reviews of 21 popular PSAPs were collected from the Amazon.com website. The reviews for each product were exported to compile individual product-specific text files. A sentiment mining analysis was completed to aggregate the number of positive and negative comments for each product. In addition, the effect of value for money, available features, perceived benefit, and overall perception of PSAPs was evaluated. A correlational analysis was completed to examine the relationship between different PSAP features and the number of positive and negative comments. Results: Mixed-model analysis of variance showed a significantly higher number of positive comments for high-and mid-cost products in terms of overall perception and perceived benefit compared to low-cost products. For feature attribute, high-cost products had significantly higher positive comments compared to mid- and low-cost products. There was a strong correlation between price and positive comments and a moderate correlation between price and negative comments. Also, there was a significant moderate correlation between presence of compression and feedback suppression PSAP features and positive comments. Conclusions: Positive sentiments expressed toward PSAPs were found to favor high- and mid-level products. However, there was a considerably high number of negative sentiments reported across all the PSAPs investigated. The noticeable thing is that the negative comments do not change significantly across price ranges. However, the positive comments significantly increase with an increase in product price range. This indicates a possible increase in benefit with high-cost products. However, this claim requires further empirical evidence through controlled studies.",1

With the escalating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on society in the United States and around the world, the CDC has become one of the focal points of public discussion. Objective: This study aims to identify the topics and their overarching themes emerging from the public COVID-19-related discussion about the CDC on Twitter and to further provide insight into public's concerns, focus of attention, perception of the CDC's current performance, and expectations from the CDC. Methods: Tweets were downloaded from a large-scale COVID-19 Twitter chatter data set from March 11, 2020, when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, to August 14, 2020. We used R (The R Foundation) to clean the tweets and retain tweets that contained any of five specific keywords-cdc, CDC, centers for disease control and prevention, CDCgov, and cdcgov-while eliminating all 91 tweets posted by the CDC itself. The final data set included in the analysis consisted of 290,764 unique tweets from 152,314 different users. We used R to perform the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm for topic modeling. Results: The Twitter data generated 16 topics that the public linked to the CDC when they talked about COVID-19. Among the topics, the most discussed was COVID-19 death counts, accounting for 12.16% (n=35,347) of the total 290,764 tweets in the analysis, followed by general opinions about the credibility of the CDC and other authorities and the CDC's COVID-19 guidelines, with over 20,000 tweets for each. The 16 topics fell into four overarching themes: knowing the virus and the situation, policy and government actions, response guidelines, and general opinion about credibility. Conclusions: Social media platforms, such as Twitter, provide valuable databases for public opinion. In a protracted pandemic, such as COVID-19, quickly and efficiently identifying the topics within the public discussion on Twitter would help public health agencies improve the next-round communication with the public.",1
"15096","Orientation Analysis for Chinese News Based on Word Embedding and Syntax Rules","Wang, Pengwei; Luo, Yujun; Chen, Zhen; He, Lianghua; Zhang, Zhaohui",2019,"IEEE ACCESS","Article","In this era of Internet and big data, there is billions of news generated every day, and the traditional manual methods are insufficient for public opinion orientation analysis. Especially for Chinese, which has more complicated syntax and semantic structure, and there is no space between words as separator. This greatly increases the difficulty of analyzing opinion orientation. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed aiming at solving the problem of public opinion orientation analysis based on Chinese news. The approach combines word2vec, sentiment dictionaries and syntax rules, where the word2vec can map words into different vectors with finite dimensions. Through it we can calculate the cosine similarity between the words and sentiment dictionaries to get the orientation value of target words, which is helpful for calculating the orientation value of key sentences and full text. Specifically, the process consists of three steps. First, word2vec is used to train word embedding, and every word in corpus is mapped into a given vector space. Then, key sentences are extracted from news content. Finally, pre-defined syntax rules with word vector similarity are used to analyze document orientation based on key sentences. Several experiments are conducted on both closed and open datasets, and the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",1

This study aims to propose a multi-criteria decision-making model based on OCRs to select products for consumers and provide a basis to merchants for product improvement. The model consists of three aspects of innovative work: (1) interval-valued probabilistic linguistic term sets (IVPLTSs) are used to describe consumers' sentiment opinions in text reviews, taking into account the vagueness in information representation; (2) data envelopment analysis and grey related analysis are combined as a ranking method to maximize consumers' sentiment opinions within the context of IVPLTSs; (3) based on the sentiment analysis and ranking results, product criteria are classified to provide the basis for criteria prioritization. An empirical study regarding the OCRs of six types of cars on www.autohome.com.cn is carried out to valid the proposed model. The effectiveness of the model is illustrated by comparative analysis.",1

Since the country's political re-democratization, the privatization of state-owned companies has remained on the agenda of governments from different ideological positions. Assuming the mainstream media as one of the leading influencers of public opinion, we analyzed a corpus of 869 articles from widely circulated newspapers and compared it to 344 articles in pro and anti-privatization media. The quantitative and qualitative analysis showed how the press restricts the lexical field of privatization to companies and businesses, suggesting the discourse that telecommunications is like any other business, which renders its discussion with society unnecessary. The analysis of the main collocations also showed how privatization has been represented as a historic landmark. The research contributes in two ways to public administration and organizational studies: it brings materiality to the discussion about the representations of privatization and presents a methodology of discursive analysis based on extensive collection of documents.",0

Advancements in e-commerce platforms has led to an abundance of the real-time and free forms of opinions floating on social media platforms. This real-world data are imprecise and vague hence fuzzy logic is required to deal with such subjective data. Since opinions can be fuzzy in nature and definitions of opinion words can be elucidated differently; fuzzy logic has witnessed itself as an effective method to capture the expression of opinions. The study presents an elaborate review of the around 170 published research works for SA using fuzzy logic. The primary emphasis is focused on text-based SA, audio-based SA, and fusion of text-audio features-based SA. This article discusses the various novel ways of classifying fuzzy logic-based SA research articles, which have not been accomplished by any other review article till date. The article puts forward the importance of SA tasks and identifies how fuzzy logic adds to this importance. Finally, the article outlines a taxonomy for sentiment classification based on the technique-supervised and unsupervised in the SA models and comprehensively reviews the SA approaches specific to their task. Prominently, this study highlights the suitability of fuzzy-based SA approaches into five different classes vis-a-vis (a) Sentiment Cognition from Words using fuzzy logic, (b) Sentiment Cognition from Phrases using fuzzy logic, (c) Fuzzy-rule based SA, (d) Neuro-fuzzy network-based SA, and (e) Fuzzy Emotion Recognition.

The UK and developed European countries have become an attractive destination for asylum seekers (labelled as migrants) in the past decade. The rapid rise in the number of asylum seekers, which was labelled migration crisis (Ruz, 2015), made this topic an integral part of scientific discussion on sociocultural environment. There are different factors underlying the perception of migrants by local population. The given study is devoted to the review of the usage of different linguistic means and its strategies by mass media whilst the escalation of refugee crisis in Great Britain as compared to Russia. We implement situational approach to the non-fiction factual texts, in particular, texts representing a concrete (actual) situation. Today due to the development of neural network technology we can easily define thematic structure of the text, specify the central lexis, the near peripheral lexis and the far peripheral lexis and reveal implicit information. The data of British National Corpus and Russian National Corpus is analyzed using text mining software-TextAnalyst 2.01. The relationships and patterns among key words and their associations are cluster-analyzed and contextual interpretation of semantic core is provided. Associative structures enable us to define the lexical experience of its speakers (White & Abrams, 2004) while the analysis of associative network helps to study public opinion on different social issues (File, Keczer, Vancso et al., 2018). The data for the text mine is gathered from the website Ruscorpora.ru (data set 1) and British National Corpus (data set 2). The thematic network depicts the structure of the text and the most pertinent information in the data. The semantic network constructs a list of topics and their semantic weights. It is a tree structure of the concepts of the text and identifies the relationships in the text. Just like in data set 1 public attitudes in data set 2 towards refugees and migrants are complex. Representation of migrants and hence public opinion are complicated by predisposition to favor those using legal means to enter a country with national culture, traditional customs, laws and ability to speak the language of the host country being the key factor in integrating migrants.",1

Most studies have focused on SA techniques for widely used languages such as English, but less attention has been paid to Arabic, particularly the Saudi dialect. Most Arabic SA studies have built systems using supervised approaches that are domain dependent; hence, they achieve low performance when applied to a new domain different from the learning domain, and they require manually labelled training data, which are usually difficult to obtain. In this article, we propose a novel lexicon-based algorithm for Saudi dialect SA that features domain independence. We created an annotated Saudi dialect dataset and built a large-scale lexicon for the Saudi dialect. Then, we developed our weighted lexicon-based algorithm. The proposed algorithm mines the associations between polarity and non-polarity words for the dataset and then weights these words based on their associations. During algorithm development, we also proposed novel rules for handling some linguistic features such as negation and supplication. Several experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.",1

The paper presents the systems used and the results of this analysis, which was performed on social media posts from Twitter and Reddit. To achieve this, a specialized lexicon of terms was used to query social media content from the dedicated application programming interfaces (APIs) that the aforementioned social media platforms provide. The captured posts were then analyzed using a sentiment analysis framework, developed using state-of-the-art deep machine learning (ML) models. This framework provides labeling for the captured posts based on their content (i.e., classifies them as positive or negative opinions). The results of this classification were used to identify fears and autonomous mobility aspects that affect negative opinions. This method can provide a more realistic view of the general public's perception of automated mobility, as it has the ability to analyze thousands of opinions and encapsulate the users' opinion in a semi-automated way.",1

In addition to them being trained on unimodal information, many transformer-based models have been proposed for multimodal information. In multimodal learning, a common problem encountered is the insufficiency of multimodal training data. In this study, to address this problem, a simple and effective method is proposed by using 1) unimodal pre-trained transformer models as encoders for each modal input and 2) a set of transformer layers to fuse their output representations. Further, the proposed method is evaluated by conducting several experiments on two common benchmarks: CMU multimodal opinion sentiment intensity dataset and multimodal internet movie database. The proposed model exhibits state-of-the-art performances on both benchmarks and is robust against the reduction in the amount of training data.",0

Specifically, we apply a scoring function to rank words importance without depending on the parameters or structure of the deep neural model. Then, we scan characteristics of these words to identify the model's weakness and perturb words to craft targeted attacks that exploit this weakness. We conduct extensive experiments on different neural network models across several real-world datasets. We report four intriguing findings: i) modern deep learning models for sentiment analysis ignore important sentiment terms such as opinion adjectives (i.e., amazing or terrible), ii) adjective words contribute to fooling sentiment analysis models more than other Parts-of-Speech (POS) categories, iii) changing or removing up to 10 adjectives words in a review text only decreases the accuracy up to 2%, and iv) modern models are unable to recognize the difference between an objective and a subjective review text(1).",0

However, research in this field has not received sufficient attention, and extracting useful information is still challenging. This paper aims to improve disaster relief efficiency via mining and analyzing social media data like public attitudes toward disaster response and public demands for targeted relief supplies during different types of disasters. We focus on different natural disasters based on properties such as types, durations, and damages, which contains a total of 41,993 tweets. In this paper, public perception is assessed qualitatively by manually classified tweets, which contain information like the demand for targeted relief supplies, satisfactions of disaster response, and public fear. Public attitudes to natural disasters are studied via a quantitative analysis using eight machine learning models. To better provide decision-makers with the appropriate model, the comparison of machine learning models based on computational time and prediction accuracy is conducted. The change of public opinion during different natural disasters and the evolution of peoples' behavior of using social media for disaster relief in the face of the identical type of natural disasters as Twitter continues to evolve are studied. The results in this paper demonstrate the feasibility and validation of the proposed research approach and provide relief agencies with insights into better disaster management.",1

Motivated by this observation and inspired by the recently proposed BERT architecture, we study Target-oriented Multimodal Sentiment Classification (TMSC) and propose a multimodal BERT architecture. To model intra-modality dynamics, we first apply BERT to obtain target-sensitive textual representations. We then borrow the idea from self-attention and design a target attention mechanism to perform target-image matching to derive target-sensitive visual representations. To model inter-modality dynamics, we further propose to stack a set of self-attention layers on top to capture multi-modal interactions. Experimental results show that our model can outperform several highly competitive approaches for TSC and TMSC1.",1

Such methods determine and represent users' preference knowledge by conducting user sentiment, aspect sentiment and topic analysis as recognized in the review texts. However, the discovered item topics from topic-based methods may not fit the preferences of most users while the discovered users' opinions and aspects' sentiments from sentiment based methods may not reflect each user's opinion. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to learn and represent users' preference knowledge from review texts and utilize the acquired representation to support rating prediction. Our approach assumes that user preferences are affected by relevant item aspects and majority preference which can be captured through proper summarization and representation of users' review texts. Thus, two deep learning practices are established: the recurrent neural network- Long Short-Term Memory (RNN-LSTM) architecture to learn users' preference knowledge along with item aspects which influence preferences and the Doc2Vec algorithm to convert the acquired knowledge to a suitable representation. The approach extends probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) model by strengthening its latent factors predictions with the acquired preference knowledge which is used to regulate the predictions. Our experiments on the Amazon products dataset have revealed the capability of learning a suitable representation for users' preference knowledge and its impact on rating prediction as our proposed approach beats alternative methods.

Despite the complex relationship between the overall user's preference and individual diverse opinions, existing approaches generally employ empirical assumptions about sentiment features of the products of interest. In this paper, we propose a novel unified approach for learning to rank products based on online product reviews. Unlike existing approaches, it uses deep-learning techniques to extract the high-level latent review representation that contains the most semantic information in the learning process. For this approach, we extend the recently proposed hierarchical attention network to operate in the ranking domain. This network hierarchically learns optimal feature representations of the products and their reviews through the use of two-level attention-based encoders. To construct a more advanced ranking model, several features were added to give sufficient information about the relative user preferences, and two representative ranking loss functions, RankNet and ListNet, were applied. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this network outperforms the existing methods in sales rank prediction based on online product reviews.",1

(58251033700)",2023,"International Journal of Advanced Technology and Engineering Exploration","Article","Technological advancements in e-commerce and Web 2.0 have revolutionized the way customers express their opinions about services and features through reviews on various websites. This trend is especially prevalent in the travel industry, where online sources provide valuable insights into the food and shelter aspects of destinations. However, the sheer volume of reviews available online makes it challenging for travellers to filter relevant information. To address this issue, aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is proposed as a technique to extract feature-based opinions. Topic modelling and sentiment analysis are two significant techniques used to assist with this analysis. Topic modelling is the process of identifying thematic relationships among documents, while sentiment analysis identifies the opinions expressed in the text. In this study, one of the leading travel websites, Tripadvisor, is used to collect customer reviews of various restaurants, which are then subjected to aspect-based sentiment analysis using latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) and ensemble bagging support vector machine (EBSVM) classifier techniques. The aim is to identify the most relevant aspect for the restaurant domain and improve sentiment analysis performance. To address the issue of class imbalances in the datasets, synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) is implemented. The performance of the LDA is evaluated using the coherence score, which produces quality topics for restaurant reviews. The effectiveness of the EBSVM classifier is measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 96.1%, which outperforms other techniques discussed in the existing literature.

"16207","Cross-domain Ontology Construction and Alignment from Online Product Reviews","Geng, Qian; Deng, Siyu; Jia, Danping; Jin, Jian",2020,"WWW'20: COMPANION PROCEEDINGS OF THE WEB CONFERENCE 2020","Proceedings Paper","Online customer product reviews often contain detailed sentiment attitudes towards different aspects of products and these online opinions help potential consumers to be familiar with products. The introduction of well-constructed domain ontology from online product reviews helps potential consumers to obtain relevant information about products quickly. Nonetheless, they may compare products in multiple domains for purchase decisions. On this basis, the comparison of products in different domains induces that ontology alignment becomes a fundamental task to form a cross-domain ontology. In this paper, a series of natural language processing approaches are applied to construct two domain ontologies from online product reviews automatically. Next, a new ontology alignment method is proposed for consumers to make purchase decisions regarding cross-domain product comparisons, in which a semantic-based algorithm and a structure-based algorithm are integrated to form a cross-domain ontology. Categories of experiments were conducted on reviews of smartphone and digital camera. Compared with benchmarked alignment tools, the proposed method performed 5% better in terms of F1 on ontology alignment. Finally, a case study with a customer friendly website is illustrated to present how the alignment of cross-domain ontology help consumers on purchase decision support.",0

H.; Alsubari, Saleh Nagi; Althobaiti, Maha M.; Fahad, Adil",2022,"COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE","Article","Most consumers rely on online reviews when deciding to purchase e-commerce services or products. Unfortunately, the main problem of these reviews, which is not completely tackled, is the existence of deceptive reviews. The novelty of the proposed system is the application of opinion mining on consumers' reviews to help businesses and organizations continually improve their market strategies and obtain an in-depth analysis of the consumers' opinions regarding their products and brands. In this paper, the long short-term memory (LSTM) and deep learning convolutional neural network integrated with LSTM (CNN-LSTM) models were used for sentiment analysis of reviews in the e-commerce domain. The system was tested and evaluated by using real-time data that included reviews of cameras, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, televisions, and video surveillance products from the Amazon website. Data preprocessing steps, such as lowercase processing, stopword removal, punctuation removal, and tokenization, were used for data cleaning. The clean data were processed with the LSTM and CNN-LSTM models for the detection and classification of the consumers' sentiment into positive or negative. The LSTM and CNN-LSTM algorithms achieved an accuracy of 94% and 91%, respectively. We conclude that the deep learning techniques applied here provide optimal results for the classification of the customers' sentiment toward the products.",1

The linguistic analysis became more complex due to grammatical variations, cultural, traditional, slang, misspellings, and language variance. Many studies in sentimental analysis have focused on natural language processing and peoples opinions. Text language processing takes time, requires lots of storage space, and a fast computer to work in distributed networks. Many developers choose Hadoop and Map Reduce to process Big Data. This study developed a methodology that employs Apache Spark as a text classification processing engine since it is faster in cluster computing systems. African libraries and packages for language lemmatization and stemming are still lacking. The proposed approach was utilized to detect offensive Swahili texts in social networks. Swahili is the third most widely spoken language in Africa. Four different machine learning techniques were tested as benchmarks, with the multinomial logistic model proving to be the most effective. The evaluation measures show that the proposed machine learning framework is versatile and suitable for usage in centralized and distributed systems.",0
"15661","Assessment of Quality of Multimodal Transportation for Containerized Exports","Dua, Aman; Sinha, Deepankar",2019,"IIM KOZHIKODE SOCIETY & MANAGEMENT REVIEW","Article","The twin paradigm of e-commerce and just-in-time has impelled the global markets for door-to-door service. Shippers do not particularly seek special modes of transport but rather demand performance of transport such as door-to-door service from the multimodal transport service (MTS) operators. Door-to-door service has also led to shift in common terms of trade such as free on board (FOB) and cost insurance freight (CIF) to delivery at place (DAP) or delivery duty paid (DDP) International Commercial Terms (incoterms). In such a case, the sellers are required to plan end-to-end rather than concentrate on port-to-port leg of the delivery process. Multimodal transportation (MMT) includes multiple modes of transport, multiple nodes (terminals) and numerous stakeholders. So far, researchers have focused on the attributes of MTS providers that affect expectations of customers. The present study looks into factors affecting performance of MTS. The approach cuts across the spectrum of qualitative to quantitative assessment. The authors, here, propose opinion mining to decipher the sentiments of clients of logistics service providers followed by open discussion (in a semi-structured format) to collate the soft and hard aspects of MMT chain. The findings of these exercises are used to frame a structured questionnaire for quantitative analysis. Four dimensions affecting quality of MMT have been identified, and one of them is found to be significant only under certain conditions. This article suggests implementation of an integrated digital ecosystem to enhance the quality of MMT in emerging markets like India.",0

After a retrieval process of the most relevant keywords, bag-of-words approaches produce words x time-points contingency tables, i.e. the frequencies of each word in the set of texts grouped by time-points. Through the analysis of word counts over the observed period of time, main purpose of the study is, after reconstructing the life-cycle of words, clustering words that have similar life-cycles and, thus, detecting prototypical or exemplary temporal patterns. Unveiling such relevant and (through expert opinion) meaningful inner dynamics enables us to trace a historical narrative of the discipline of interest. However, different history readings are possible depending on the type of data normalization, which is needed to account for the fluctuating size of texts across time and the general problems of data sparsity and strong asymmetry. This study proposes a methodology consisting of (1) a stepwise information retrieval procedure for keywords' selection and (2) a functional clustering two stage approach for statistical learning. Moreover, a sample of possible normalizations of word frequencies is considered, showing that the different concept of curve similarity induced in clustering by the type of transformation heavily affects groups' composition and size. The corpus of titles of scientific papers published by the American Statistical Association journals in the time span 1888-2012 is examined for illustration. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

R.; Bagavathi Sivakumar, P.",2021,"SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING","Article","Sentiment analysis explores the views, perceptions and feelings of people concerning entities like subjects, goods, organizations, resources and individuals. The opinion of some people in social network influences the opinion behavior and thoughts of other people. They are known as influential user. In this article, both the sentiment analysis and identification of influential user are proposed. Initially, Twitter data are preprocessed by proposing weighted partition around medoids (WPAM) with artificial cooperative search (WPAM-ACS) which extracts topics from Twitter data through dynamic clustering (DC). For sentiment classification, NLP has been used in many works. The main issue of using NLP for sentiment classification is that many languages do not have the adequate resources to develop NLP models. So, a fuzzy deep neural network (FDNN) is proposed in this paper for sentiment classification, because FDNN effectively handles the uncertainties and noises in tweet data than other state of the arts. Emotional conformity is a metric that refers to how people from an emotional point of view agree with another person. It is given as additional input to FDNN along with the tweets for sentiment classification. Finally, influential users are detected by temporal influential model (TIM) formulated as likelihood function using incremental logistic regression (ILLR) in which user's opinion sequence is considered for identification of influential user. In the experimental results, sentiment analysis is evaluated in terms of precision, recall and F-measure and proved that the proposed DC-FDNN sentiment classification is better than fixed clustering and NLP (FC-NLP)-based sentiment classification. Influential user detection using TIM-ILLR on opinion sequences which are identified by DC-FDNN is evaluated in terms of accuracy and proved that TIM-ILLR is better than other methods such as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), support vector regression (SVR) and logistic regression (LR).",1

Recently, rap has become a frequent topic of discussion in the media, mainly due to the high streaming and sales statistics of the genre. Above all, the German-Ukrainian-Russian rapper Capital Bra has drawn much attention to rap in Germany after making 13 number one chart hits in 12 months. While the public and scientific discourses on Deutschrap are dominated mainly by topics such as financial success, drugs, and sexism, the research on the diversity of languages, the political and religious aspects, as well as the identity-creating function of these songs has yet to be conducted. This paper will specifically deal with the lyrics of 507 songs by both male and female German rappers with Polish and Russian language backgrounds. The study statistically evaluates the languages used in the lyrics to determine the language contact tendencies. With corpus linguistics methods, this study also explores questions about how Germany, the respective countries of origin, and the concept of the homeland are connotated in the songs. In addition, a statistical experiment contrasts the lyrics’ stylistics and measures the linguistic distance between the musicians’ songs. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",0

Using review metadata (e.g., star rating) to observe variation in reviewer feelings and motivations, we test for the strength of different message design logics: expressive logics, where language reflects a reviewer's underlying opinion, and rhetorical logics, where language reflects a reviewer's desire to make his or her opinion credible and acceptable to their audience. Results suggest that emotional language is motivated by expression as higher rated businesses are reviewed with more positive and fewer negative emotion terms. Rhetorical logics are associated with the use of abstract and self-focused language, with analysis suggesting this may result from the reviewer's decision to write either narratively or formally.",0

The establishment of high-tech policing in Lahore, Pakistan, known as the Punjab Safe Cities Authority (PSCA), Lahore, along with integrated command and control centers and various equipments, such as 8,000 cameras, monitoring sensors, etc., has resulted in a requirement for its performance evaluation and social media-enabled opinion mining to determine the broader impact on communities. Social sensing of civil services has been enabled through the presence of the PSCA on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Web TV. The SA of the local civil services is not possible without taking into account the local language. In this article, we utilize machine learning techniques to perform multi-class SA of public opinion on policing authority and the provided civil services in both the local languages Urdu and English. The support vector machine provides the highest performance multi-classification accuracy of 86.87% for positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

To this aim, we first tested some classifiers for determining the most suitable one in terms of performance and complexity for the stance detection problem under consideration. Then, we compared several approaches aimed at counteracting the occurrence of concept drift, i.e., that phenomenon for which the characteristics of the dataset vary over time, possibly resulting in a degradation of classification accuracy.

There is a growing need for management and study of SPD not only in English, but also in other languages. The key reason for using Machine Learning (ML) for SPD lies in engineering a representative set of features. This paper explores different (byte, character and word) n-gram based text representation models in order to determine the most valuable model for the representation of text documents in various languages, which can be used successfully by ML classification techniques for solving SPD task. Proposed n-gram models were used in conjunction with k Nearest Neighbourhood (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithms to determine opinion polarity of the proposed movie reviews. The effectiveness and language independence of the proposed n-gram models were demonstrated in experiments performed on seven publicly available movie review benchmarks in Arabic, Czech, English, French, Spanish, Turkish, and Serbian being the authors' mother tongue. Formal evaluation has confirmed that the proposed byte and character n-gram models outperform word n-gram model, and in conjunction with the presented MaxEnt algorithm outperform other ML supervised techniques used with more complex document representation approaches. In some cases (Arabic, Czech, French, Serbian and Turkish), signficant improvements over the baselines have been achieved. Despite their simplicity and broad applicability, byte and character n-grams have been shown to be able to capture information on different levels - lexical and syntactic.",1

Under this problem, there are several existing works focusing on aspect (or opinion) terms extraction which utilize the syntactic relations among the words given by a dependency parser. These approaches, however, require additional information and highly depend on the quality of the parsing results. As a result, they may perform poorly on user-generated texts, such as product reviews, tweets, etc., whose syntactic structure is not precise. In this work, we offer an end-to-end deep learning model without any preprocessing. The model consists of a memory network that automatically learns the complicated interactions among aspect words and opinion words. Moreover, we extend the network with a multi-task manner to solve a finer-grained opinion mining problem, which is more challenging than the traditional fine-grained opinion mining problem. To be specific, the finer-grained problem involves identification of aspect and opinion terms within each sentence, as well as categorization of the identified terms at the same time. To this end, we develop an end-to-end multi-task memory network, where aspect/opinion terms extraction for a specific category is considered as a task, and all the tasks are learned jointly by exploring commonalities and relationships among them. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of our proposed model on several benchmark datasets. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1

The ability of distinguishing between the two account types is needed for developing recommendation engines, consumer products opinion mining tools, and information dissemination platforms. However, such a task is non-trivial. Classic and consolidated approaches of text mining use textual features from natural language processing for classification. Nevertheless, such approaches still have some drawbacks like the computational cost and time consumption. In this work, we propose a statistical approach based on post frequency, metadata of user profile, and popularity of posts so as to recognize the type of users without textual content. We performed a set of experiments over a twitter dataset and learn-based algorithms in classification task. Several supervised learning algorithms were tested.

Sentiment analysis is beneficial in understanding users' opinions and thoughts on social, economic, and political issues. It eliminates the manual monitoring of each and every review, which is a cumbersome task. However, performing sentiment analysis on code-mix data is challenging, as it involves various out of vocabulary terms and numerous issues, making it a new field in natural language processing. This work includes dealing with such text and ensembling a classifier to detect sentiment polarity. Our classifier ensembles a multilingual variant of RoBERTa and a sentence-level embedding from Universal Sentence Encoder to identify the sentiments of these code-mixed tweets with higher accuracy. This ensemble optimises the classifier's performance by using the strength of both for transfer learning. Experiments were conducted on real-life benchmark datasets and revealed their sentiment. The performance of the proposed classifier framework is compared with other baselines and deep learning models on five datasets to show the superiority of our results. Results showed improved and increased performance in the proposed classifier's accuracy, precision, and recall. The accuracy achieved by our classifier on code-mix datasets is 66% on Joshi et al. 2016, 60% on SAIL 2017, and 67% on SemEval 2020 Task-9 dataset, which is on average around 3% as compared to contemporary baselines.",0

And with the explosive growth of text information flow in social network, the topic detection and the sentiment analysis have become important researches in the field of NLP (natural language processing). There are two ways to analyze the sentiment tendency: traditional statistics method and machine learning method. At present, with the extensive application of machine learning method in NLP, various neural network models have achieved commendable results in the research of sentiment classification. However, such methods require a long period in training and learning process, and the training effect may be over fitting depended on the training set. In addition, such methods usually do not consider the vector space characteristics and lacks of the use of the word sentiment label. Standing around problem, this paper creates a sentiment classification method which combined with the feature of text vector space and the convolutional neural network method. Firstly, the words are ranked and selected according to the spatial distribution features in text information. Then the processed words are mapped into abstract vectors based on the existing dictionary resources. And the convolutional neural network is utilized to extract features of abstract vectors for the sentiment classification. This paper puts forward the relevant methods obtained superb performance in the Chinese tendency analysis evaluation (COAE 2014) data sets.",0

Our focus is on automatic deception detection in text across cultures. In this context, we view culture through the prism of the individualism/collectivism dimension, and we approximate culture by using country as a proxy. Having as a starting point recent conclusions drawn from the social psychology discipline, we explore if differences in the usage of specific linguistic features of deception across cultures can be confirmed and attributed to cultural norms in respect to the individualism/collectivism divide. In addition, we investigate if a universal feature set for cross-cultural text deception detection tasks exists. We evaluate the predictive power of different feature sets and approaches. We create culture/language-aware classifiers by experimenting with a wide range of n-gram features from several levels of linguistic analysis, namely phonology, morphology and syntax, other linguistic cues like word and phoneme counts, pronouns use, etc., and token embeddings. We conducted our experiments over eleven data sets from five languages (English, Dutch, Russian, Spanish, and Romanian), from six countries (United States of America, Belgium, India, Russia, Mexico, and Romania), and we applied two classification methods, namely logistic regression and fine-tuned BERT models. The results showed that the undertaken task is fairly complex and demanding. Furthermore, there are indications that some linguistic cues of deception have cultural origins and are consistent in the context of diverse domains and data set settings for the same language. This is more evident for the usage of pronouns and the expression of sentiment in deceptive language. The results of this work show that the automatic deception detection across cultures and languages cannot be handled in unified manners and that such approaches should be augmented with knowledge about cultural differences and the domains of interest.",0
"15173","TextFirewall: Omni-Defending Against Adversarial Texts in Sentiment Classification","Wang, Wenqi; Wang, Run; Ke, Jianpeng; Wang, Lina",2021,"IEEE ACCESS","Article","Sentiment classification has been broadly applied in real life, such as product recommendation and opinion-oriented analysis. Unfortunately, the widely employed sentiment classification systems based on deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to adversarial attacks with imperceptible perturbations into the legitimate texts (also called adversarial texts). Adversarial texts could cause erroneous outputs even without access to the target model, bringing security concerns to systems deployed in safety-critical applications. However, studies on defending against adversarial texts are still in the early stage and not ready for tackling the emerging threats, especially in dealing with unknown attacks. Investigating the minor differences between adversarial texts and legitimate texts and enhancing the robustness of target models are two mainstream ideas for defending against adversarial texts. However, both of them suffer the generalization issue in dealing with unknown adversarial attacks. In this paper, we proposed a general method, called TextFirewall, for defending against adversarial texts crafted by various adversarial attacks, which shows the potential in identifying new developed adversarial attacks in the future. Given a piece of text, our TextFirewall identifies the adversarial text by investigating the inconsistency between the target model's output and the impact value calculated by important words in the text. TextFirewall could be deployed as a third-party tool without modifying the target model and agnostic to the specific type of adversarial texts. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed TextFirewall effectively identifies adversarial texts generated by the three state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks and outperforms previous defense techniques. Specifically, TextFirewall achieves an average accuracy of 90.7% on IMDB and 96.9% on Yelp in defending the three SOTA attacks.",0

Our paper addresses the important question: what is the influence of word sense disambiguation in real-world scenarios and how it compares to the simpler baseline of labeling using just the tag of the most frequent sense. We evaluate both approaches on data sets compiled for studies on fake opinion detection and predicting levels of self-esteem in the area of social psychology. Our conclusion is that the baseline method vastly outperforms its competitor.",0

Ryan",2019,"FEMALE PELVIC MEDICINE AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY","Article","Objectives The purpose of this study was to utilize sentiment analysis to describe online opinions toward vaginal mesh. We hypothesized that sentiment in legal Web sites would be more negative than that in medical and reference Web sites. Methods We generated a list of relevant key words related to vaginal mesh and searched Web sites using the Google search engine. Each unique uniform resource locator (URL) was sorted into 1 of 6 categories: medical, legal, news/media, patient generated, reference, or unrelated. Sentiment of relevant Web sites, the primary outcome, was scored on a scale of -1 to +1, and mean sentiment was compared across all categories using 1-way analysis of variance. Tukey test evaluated differences between category pairs. Result Google searches of 464 unique key words resulted in 11,405 URLs. Sentiment analysis was performed on 8029 relevant URLs (3472 legal, 1625 medical, 1774 reference, 666 news media, 492 patient generated). The mean sentiment for all relevant Web sites was +0.01 +/- 0.16; analysis of variance revealed significant differences between categories (P < 0.001). Web sites categorized as legal and news/media had a slightly negative mean sentiment, whereas those categorized as medical, reference, and patient generated had slightly positive mean sentiments. Tukey test showed differences between all category pairs except the medical versus reference in comparison with the largest mean difference (-0.13) seen in the legal versus reference comparison. Conclusions Web sites related to vaginal mesh have an overall mean neutral sentiment, and Web sites categorized as medical, reference, and patient generated have significantly higher sentiment scores than related Web sites in legal and news/media categories.",1

A corpus of 12,458 Twitter posts was constructed covering the period 2020-2021. For data analysis, the study adopted a discourse-based mining approach, combining vector space classification (VSC) and collocation analysis. The results indicate that most users had negative attitudes and sentiments regarding the performance of the telecommunications companies during the pandemic, as reflected in both the lexical semantic properties and discoursal and thematic features of their Twitter posts. The study of collocates and the discoursal properties of the data was useful in attaining a deeper understanding of the users' responses and attitudes to the performance of the telecommunications companies during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was not possible for text clustering based on the bag of words model alone to address the discoursal features in the corpus. Opinion mining applications, especially in Arabic, thus need to integrate discourse approaches to gain a better understanding of people's opinions and attitudes regarding given issues.",1

We propose an empirical framework, which accounts for public sanctions (in our case cartel fines) and a more direct measure of reputational sanctions, harnessing recent developments in opinion mining. We use the intensity and the sentiment of media exposure of misconduct as a measure of reputational effect and thus approximation of the reputational sanction. As a demonstration, we combine an event study approach, sentiment analysis, and econometric techniques on a sample of 339 listed cartel member firms, prosecuted by the European Commission between 1992 and 2015. Our results offer evidence that in the context of cartels, public and reputational sanctions act as substitutes: where there is a reputational penalty, increasing this penalty reduces the effect of the public sanction. One the other hand, in the absence of a reputational punishment, the effect of the cartel fine steps in. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1

Most studies in this area, however, have focused on a sentiment analysis. In this study, we consider review mining from another perspective, that is, capturing user justifications behind whatever actions are explicitly stated in their app reviews, e.g., the reason behind user purchases. This study highlights how different app features can promote different user decisions, which in turn can be beneficial for software developers to gain valuable data-driven requirements for the planning and development of application updates. We collected, used, and shared our manually annotated 46k mobile app reviews from 12 different app categories in the Google Play Store. We designed three classification problems to filter reviews containing both arguments and decisions from non-argumentative reviews. We extracted three features, namely, structural, lexical, and contextual, from the body of review sentences. Four classifiers (naive Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest) and different feature combinations were trained on the dataset and evaluated to examine if such features can allow us to classify user arguments and decisions. The results show an improved performance over previous studies and show the efficacy of the proposed approach compared to human-assessments.",1

In Indonesia, the government has made regulations supporting the implementation of EVs through various incentive programs and infrastructure developments, which are expected to increase public interest in the use of EVs. However, there are still many pros and cons found in the use of EVs in Indonesia, especially in social media. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of sentiment analysis models through social media, Twitter. It uses supervised learning methods, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Algorithm, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The total data used is 7102 tweets with 2847 tweet samples to become labeling data. The results of the analysis are as many as 1586 tweets (55,71%) responded positively and 1261 (44,29%) responded negatively to EVs. SVM is the best model with 75.08% accuracy and the most topics that support EVs to appear were the temporary G20 activities and the benefit of EVs with positive support of tweets. And others tend to prioritize primary needs than own EVs. We utilize Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to examine topics related to EVs in Indonesia. Finally, this paper contributes to extending knowledge of sentiment methods from the discussion that sticks out on social media, and suitable techniques for conducting research related to sentiment analysis as well as topics of discussion that are closely related to the issue of EVs. © 2023 IEEE.",1

G.; Cerri, Ricardo; Paraiso, Emerson Cabrera; Mantovani, Rafael Gomes; Barbon Junior, Sylvio",2018,"NEUROCOMPUTING","Article","Sentiment Analysis is an emerging research field traditionally applied to classify opinions, sentiments and emotions towards polarity and subjectivity expressed in text. An important characteristic to automatic emotion analysis is the standpoint, in which we can look at an opinion from two perspectives, the opinion holder (author) who express an opinion, and the reader who reads and perceives the opinion. From the reader's standpoint, the interpretations of the text can be multiple and depend on the personal background. The multiple standpoints cognition, in which readers can look at the same sentence, is an interesting scenario to use the multi-label classification paradigm in the Sentiment Analysis domain. This methodology is able to handle different target sentiments simultaneously in the same text, by also taking advantage of the relations between them. We applied different approaches such as algorithm adaptation, problem transformation and ensemble methods in order to explore the wide range of multi-label solutions. The experiments were conducted on 10,080 news sentences from two different real datasets. Experimental results showed that the Ensemble Classifier Chain overcame the other algorithms, average F-measure of 64.89% using emotion strength features, when considering six emotions and neutral sentiment.

The study surveyed 220 people via online questionnaire to learn more about their experiences with and motivations for using AI-powered conversational agents. An overview of the demographics of the participants was provided through descriptive statistics. This investigation of the subject at hand lays the groundwork for further research. It also reveals the hidden meanings of the observed phenomena, and it suggests possible solutions to the problems that have been uncovered. This research looks at how AI systems and chatbots can supplement human knowledge and judgment, as well as their potential drawbacks. The results showed that participants thought Chat GPT integration was moderately accessible and had moderately positive social attitudes. They understood the value and responsibility of Chat GPT in creating individualized educational opportunities. Participants stressed the necessity for explicit institutional standards regarding privacy and data security. Gender, age, sense of accessibility, social attitude, opinions, and personal experience, privacy and data security, institutional guidelines, and individualized learning were also found to affect participants' reliance on AI through regression analysis. The findings shed light on how the integration of Chat GPT into Latinoamerican higher education is complicated by factors such as individual beliefs, cultural norms, and ethical problems. The busy schedules of students may be accommodated and the resources they need to succeed can be made available thanks to this adaptability. In addition, natural language processing models can offer students instantaneous help via text chat, voice, or video. To fully grasp the ethical consequences and lead the creation of responsible implementation techniques, the research proposes that additional qualitative investigations, longitudinal studies, and comparative research across diverse contexts is required. Closing these knowledge gaps will help move the conversational AI field forward in ways that are ethical and beneficial to the classroom. © The Author 2023.

There exist many solvers of the above individual subtasks or a combination of two subtasks, and they can work together to tell a complete story, i.e. the discussed aspect, the sentiment on it, and the cause of the sentiment. However, no previous ABSA research tried to provide a complete solution in one shot. In this paper, we introduce a new subtask under ABSA, named aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE). Particularly, a solver of this task needs to extract triplets (What, How, Why) from the inputs, which show WHAT the targeted aspects are, HOW their sentiment polarities are and WHY they have such polarities (i.e. opinion reasons). For instance, one triplet from Waiters are very friendly and the pasta is simply average could be ('Waiters', positive, 'friendly'). We propose a two-stage framework to address this task. The first stage predicts what, how and why in a unified model, and then the second stage pairs up the predicted what (how) and why from the first stage to output triplets. In the experiments, our framework has set a benchmark performance in this novel triplet extraction task. Meanwhile, it outperforms a few strong baselines adapted from state-of-the-art related methods.",1

The population policy change from the rigid One-Child Policy to the Selective Two-Child Policy then to the Universal Two-Child Policy aroused great attention of the Chinese people. Design/methodology/approach This research uses the crawler technique to extract data on the Sina Weibo platform. Through opinion mining of Weibo posts on two sets of population policy, the Weibo users' online opinions on the Two-Child Policy are analyzed from two perspectives: their attention intensity and sentiment tendency. The research also use the State Bureau of Statistics of China's national population data between 2011 and 2016 to examine the Chinese people's actual birth behaviors after implementing the two different sets of the Two-Child Policy. Findings The research findings indicate that the Selective Two-Child Policy (Phase 2) and the Universal Two-Child Policy are good examples of thematic public sphere of Weibo. Weibo posts on the two sets of the Two-Child Policy have undergone different opinion cycles. People from economically developed regions and populous regions have paid more attention to both sets of Two-Child Policy than their counterparts in the less developed and less populated regions. Men pay more attention to the Two-Child Policy than women do. Despite people's huge attention to the new population policy, the population growth after the policy is not sustainable. Research limitations/implications The new population policy alone is difficult to boost China's population within a short period of time. The Chinese Government must provide its people with enough incentives and supporting welfare to make the population growth happen. Originality/value These findings have important implications for understanding the dynamics of online opinion formation and changing population policy in China.",1

The sentiment analysis of reviews is a key decision-making tool for e-commerce development. Most existing review sentiment analysis methods involve sequential modeling but do not focus on the semantic relationships. However, Chinese semantics are different from English semantics in terms of the sentence structure. Irrelevant contextual words may be incorrectly identified as cues for sentiment prediction. The influence of the target words in reviews must be considered. Thus, this paper proposes the TRG-DAtt model for sentiment analysis based on target relational graph (TRG) and double attention network (DAtt) to analyze the emotional information to support decision making. First, dependency tree-based TRG is introduced to independently and fully mine the semantic relationships. We redefine and constrain the dependency and use it as the edges to connect the target and context words. Second, we design dependency graph attention network (DGAT) and interactive attention network (IAT) to form the DAtt and obtain the emotional features of the target words and reviews. DGAT models the dependency of the TRG by aggregating the semantic information. Next, the target emotional enhancement features obtained by the DGAT are input to the IAT. The influence of each target-word on the review can be obtained through the interaction. Finally, the target emotional enhancement features are weighted by the impact factor to generate the review's emotional features. In this study, extensive experiments were conducted on the car and Meituan review data sets, which contain consumer reviews on cars and stores, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the existing models.",1

Tens of millions of messages per day published by users of a certain social network must be analyzed in real time for moderation to prevent the spread of various illegal or offensive information, threats and other types of toxic comments. Of course, such a large amount of information can be processed quite quickly only automatically. That is why it is necessary to find a way to teach a computer to understand a text written by a man. It is a non-trivial task, even if the word understand here means only to detect or classify. The rapid development of machine learning technologies has led to the widespread adoption of new algorithms. Many tasks that for years were considered almost impossible to solve using computer now can be successfully solved with deep learning technologies. In this article, the author presents modern approaches to solving the problem of toxic comments detection using deep learning technologies and neural networks.

Opinions and feelings about a location are the most important factors for travelers to make a travel decision in its favor. While we form our views based on news reports, the characteristics of a travel destination, and the events happening there, not all characteristics and events have the same impact on our opinions. Different categories of events, like terrorism, economic turmoil, and acts of war and violence, trigger different emotions with different impacts on the tourism and hospitality business. This empirical study will create a classification scheme for different types of events based on empirical data picked up from tourist arrival statistics and news reports in the online media. Observation of the sentiment in the media toward destinations helps in estimating the upcoming demand. One of the main issues of this tourism demand model is that not all bad news has the same effect. Even if long periods of highly negative news sentiments of one kind might have just a slight impact on tourist arrivals, negative news sentiments of a different kind might directly lead to a sharp decline in the number of arrivals. To address this issue and to improve sentiment-based demand models, we built a classification scheme that categorizes the types of sentiments. We hope that our research will improve tourism demand models based on sentiments. Our methodology uses artificial neural network software that analyzes the sentiment in the online media. The software rates every news item that refers to a potential tourist destination, either positive or negative. It further classifies the topic of the article to determine its background. We compared this data with the change rate of tourist arrivals to classify which topics have a stronger and which a weaker impact. The classification shows that different types of negative sentiments can lead to different levels of arousal of potential travelers. An improved sentiment index that weighs the severity of the number of published news based on the expected arousal that their content creates can complement the existing explanatory variables of tourist arrival models in a timely manner.",1

Yet, a comprehensive analysis of emotional political rhetoric during the COVID-19 crisis is still missing. Based on parties' position in the political arena (government versus populist radical parties), I expect differences in how specific emotions are employed and in how these messages actually influence the public. To test my hypotheses, I use word embeddings and neural network classifiers to measure fear and hope appeals in social media messages of political parties in four European countries. Furthermore, I rely on more than 1,400,000 public tweets of random citizens to estimate the impact of party messages. To do so, I employ vector autoregression (VAR) analysis to compare retweet volumes of political messages to emotional expressions in public tweets. Results indicate two main findings, (1) populist radical parties communicate less about the pandemic and decrease fear and increase hope appeals while COVID case numbers are rising whereas government parties exhibit the opposite pattern; (2) increased diffusion of party tweets consistently precedes change in partisans' emotional expressions the following day. The findings can carry important implications for (affective) polarization and the level of protective behavior among the population.",0
"16416","Extraction of Code-mixed Aspect Topics in Semantic Representation","Asnani, Kavita; Pawar, Jyoti D.",2018,"COMPUTACION Y SISTEMAS","Article","With recent advancements and popularity of social networking forums, millions of people virtually connected to the World Wide Web, commonly communicate in multiple languages. This has led to the generation of large volumes of unstructured code-mixed social media text having useful aspects of information highly dispersed. Aspect based opinion mining relates opinion targets to their polarity values, in a specific context. It is known that since aspects are often implicit, detecting and retrieving them is a difficult task. Moreover, it is very challenging as the code-mixed social media text suffers from its associated linguistic complexities. As a standard, topic modeling has a potential of extracting aspects pertaining to opinion data from large text. This results not only in retrieval of implicit aspects but also in clustering them together. In this paper we propose knowledge based language independent code-mixed semantic LDA (lcms-LDA) model, with an aim to improve the coherence of clusters. We find that the proposed lcms-LDA model infers topic distributions without language barrier, based on semantics associated with words. Our experimental results showed an increase in the UMass and KL divergence score indicating an improved performance in the resulting coherence and distinctiveness of aspect clusters in comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques used for aspect extraction of code-mixed data.",0

We have prepared a new dataset that will allow the scientific community to estimate and evaluate new models using nearly the same conditions. Moreover, this dataset represents a recent and interesting sample for the proposed machine learning models to correctly identify the topics or points on which the company should focus to improve customer satisfaction and better meet their needs. Therefore, we have proposed a recurrent neural network (RNN) with Long short-term memory (LSTM) that we will run in the cloud to predict sentiment analysis. The objective is also to define systems capable of extracting subjective information from natural language texts, such as feelings and opinions, with the aim of creating structured knowledge that can be used by a decision support system or a decision maker for better customer management. The proposed neural network has been trained on the proposed dataset which contains 50 000 customer observations. The performance of the proposed architecture is very important as the success rate is 96 %.",1

This is partly because the patterns that underlie deceptive text are not known. The aim of this work is to identify patterns that characterize deceptive text. A key step in this approach is to train a classifier based on the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) network. BERT beats the state of the art in deception classification accuracy on the Ott Deceptive Opinion Spam corpus. The results of our ablation study indicate that certain components of the input, such as some parts of speech, are more informative to the classifier than others. Further part-of-speech analysis in swing sentences that are considered important to BERT's classification indicates that deceptive text is more formulaic and less varied than truthful text. We expanded our classifier into a new Generative Adversarial Network based on BERT to create exemplars of deceptive and truthful text that further showed the differences between truth and deception, reinforcing the underlying similarity of deceptive text in terms of part-of-speech makeup.",0

Previous research shows that people often look for opinions that reinforce their pre-existing beliefs and stances, which may lead to social polarization. Traditional social media present opinions in a linear list format, which not only lacks structures for people to explore diverse viewpoints but also aggravates their selective exposure to agreeable opinions. To address this problem, we designed an intelligent system that improves awareness of diverse social opinions by providing visual hints and recommendations of opinions (e.g. news articles and comments) on different sides with different indicators. We evaluated our system with news articles about Obamacare repeal issue and their corresponding user comments from Facebook. Results demonstrate that our system could increase people's awareness of their stances and opinion selection preferences, which mitigates selective exposure and thereby leads to a more balanced perception of social opinions.",1

Despite the social good, social media has become a fertile ground for spreading misinformation, hate speech and conspiracy theories. The death of George Floyd in May 2020 triggered a series of protests worldwide in support of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement and triggered a debate about equity, inclusion and social justice. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of misinformation and social noise on the original intended message of BLM using data from the Twitter hashtag 'BLM'. Results from topic modelling have shown the strong presence of misinformation and social noise. Such information was most probably intended to influence, mislead and dilute the original intended message. However, despite the effort to distort the original message of BLM, results from sentiment analysis show that users' opinions of the BLM movement remained positive.",1

Online social networks analysis seems to be good tools to quickly monitor the population behavior where users freely share large amounts of information related to their own lives on day-to-day basis. This novel kind of data can be used to get additional real time insights from people to understand their actual behavior related to drug use (Cortes et al., 2017). The aim of this research is to generated an information fusion model of marijuana use tendency confident enough to be employed by stakeholders. So, we will: (a) collect and process the data from Twitter; (b) design a set of algorithms to estimate the tendency of marijuana use in relation to age, localization and gender, moreover, used a set of processes and activities to verify if our model were performing as expected; and (c) fusion of the information in a model to fully characterize the marijuana use population comparable to the national marijuana consume survey for policy makers utilization to improve drug use prevention. First,we collect the data from Twitter accounts based in Chile using an algorithm for traversing graph data structures, we collected the data from Twitter accounts based in Chile. Then, we estimated marijuana user prevalence during a period from 2006 to 2018 and, within each of the years we predicted the prevalence of user population in relation with age (in range), the localization (regions) and gender.

"13881","Cost-based text understanding to improve maintenance knowledge intelligence in manufacturing enterprises","Ansari, Fazel",2020,"COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING","Article","Improving maintenance knowledge intelligence using text data has not been largely explored in the literature of production and engineering management. The state-of-the-art approaches and solutions mainly focus on either clustering and classification of maintenance logs, or extracting additional (meta-)data e.g. failure time data from maintenance text reports, operators' workbooks and digital logbook. Knowledge Discovery from Text (KDT) enables finding undetected causalities, hidden patterns, frequencies, associative relations, and sentiments in maintenance text repositories. Applying KDT may enhance understanding the content of text data syntactically and semantically. However, advanced KDT approaches do not significantly provide meaningful and explainable outcomes, due to certain barriers in manufacturing enterprises, namely availability and quality of (longitudinal) maintenance text data. To overcome these barriers in real world industrial maintenance, generate added value in industrial maintenance, and lay the ground for autonomous maintenance decision-support in the context of Industry 4.0, the first step is to adopt KDT methods and accordingly provide maintenance-specific solutions considering practical challenges and possibilities. This paper discusses the lack of understanding maintenance text data and examines its effect on maintenance knowledge intelligence in manufacturing enterprises. A compositional framework for text understanding (TextPlan) is introduced. TextPlan explores quantification of text data in both syntax and semantic levels, i.e. how to vectorize an annotated maintenance report into numeric values, which represent cost data, hidden associations and sentiments. A prominent feature of TextPlan is cost-based text analysis, which decomposes a maintenance text report into separate cost items, and then (re-)composes the findings to estimate the total maintenance cost associated with the given report. Finally yet importantly, TextPlan consolidates the findings into a Text Understanding Map for assisting maintenance planner, based on three proposed measures of text comprehension, namely Association Measuring Index (AMI), Opinion Index (OI) and Cost Vector (CV).",0

Monitoring the attitude of customers and analyzing their written sentiments to evaluate their opinions toward a particular product, topic or situation becomes essential to improve the product quality and customer services. Due to the importance of sentiment analysis (SA), a plethora of tools and systems have been developed for analyzing the polarities of people's sentiments. However, SA is a difficult task, especially when dealing with massive data resources. Feature selection (FS) algorithms are needed for the machine learning (ML) process to reduce the high dimensionality space. In this paper, we propose an enhancement of a bio-inspired optimizer, called the salp swarm algorithm (SSA) designed for feature selection to solve the problem of Arabic sentiment analysis. Our proposed algorithm operates in two phases: The first phase employs a filtering technique based on the information gain (IG) metric to reduce the number of features. The second phase employs a wrapper technique which combines the basic SSA optimizer with four variants of S-shaped transfer functions. Experimental results show that the SSA combined with the S-shaped transfer functions outperformed the particle swarms optimizer (PSO) and the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) in term of classification accuracy.",1

These reviews and comments express user's opinions about different topics. As a result, there is a great need to understand and classify these reviews. Sentiment Analysis Systems is a good way to overcome this problem. Reviews are considered as short texts and they are different from traditional documents without enough contextual information. To address this issue, we propose an efficient representation for short text based on concepts instead of terms, which transforms the data representation into a shorter, more compact, and more predictive one. However, for the Arabic language, the majority of semantic resources are incomplete projects; this may presents a serious problem about the coverage ratio of the Arabic language compared with other Languages. To overcome this problem and starting with the assumption that terms belonging to same topic share many semantic links in the same dataset, their corresponding concepts will share the same semantics links in the same dataset. We suggest integrating Topic Modeling as a tool to bring together terms with the same semantic links.

However, this sector faces various challenges, such as issues related to service quality, innovation, efficiency, and sustainability, as well as macro-level challenges such as globalization, geopolitical risks, failures of financial institutions, technological disruptions, climate change, demographic shifts, and regulatory changes. The impacts of these challenges on society and the economy can be both significant and unpredictable, potentially endangering sustainability. Therefore, it is crucial to comprehensively study services and service economies at both holistic and local levels. To this end, the objective of this study is to develop and validate an artificial-intelligence-based methodology to gain a comprehensive understanding of the service sector by identifying key parameters from the academic literature and public opinion. This methodology aims to provide in-depth insights into the creation of smarter, more sustainable services and economies, ultimately contributing to the development of sustainable future societies. A software tool is developed that employs a data-driven approach involving the use of word embeddings, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and word importance. A large dataset comprising 175 K research articles was created from the Scopus database, and after analysis, 29 distinct parameters related to the service sector were identified and grouped into 6 macro-parameters: smart society and infrastructure, digital transformation, service lifecycle management, and others. The analysis of over 112 K tweets collected from Saudi Arabia identified 11 parameters categorized into 2 macro-parameters: private sector services and government services. The software tool was used to generate a knowledge structure, taxonomy, and framework for the service sector, in addition to a detailed literature review based on over 300 research articles.

The proposed measure is an amalgamation of semantic similarity, relatedness, and distance. The measure allows performing an in-depth analysis of various semantic relationships between concepts of the English language. The performance of the measure was evaluated against benchmarked dimension reduction techniques such as PCA. The results show improvement by reducing the size of dimensions up to 35%. The results were further evaluated by training a classifier to validate that the features are not creating any underfit/overfit model.",1
"12729","A Fuzzy Approach to Text Classification With Two-Stage Training for Ambiguous Instances","Liu, Han; Burnap, Pete; Alorainy, Wafa; Williams, Matthew L.",2019,"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS","Article","Sentiment analysis is a very popular application area of text mining and machine learning. The popular methods include support vector machine, naive bayes, decision trees, and deep neural networks. However, these methods generally belong to discriminative learning, which aims to distinguish one class from others with a clear-cut outcome, under the presence of ground truth. In the context of text classification, instances are naturally fuzzy (can be multilabeled in some application areas) and thus are not considered clear-cut, especially given the fact that labels assigned to sentiment in text represent an agreed level of subjective opinion for multiple human annotators rather than indisputable ground truth. This has motivated researchers to develop fuzzy methods, which typically train classifiers through generative learning, i.e., a fuzzy classifier is used to measure the degree to which an instance belongs to each class. Traditional fuzzy methods typically involve generation of a single fuzzy classifier and employ a fixed rule of defuzzification outputting the class with the maximum membership degree. The use of a single fuzzy classifier with the above-fixed rule of defuzzification is likely to get the classifier encountering the text ambiguity situation on sentiment data, i.e., an instance may obtain equal membership degrees to both the positive and negative classes. In this paper, we focus on cyberhate classification, since the spread of hate speech via social media can have disruptive impacts on social cohesion and lead to regional and community tensions. Automatic detection of cyberhate has thus become a priority research area. In particular, we propose a modified fuzzy approach with two-stage training for dealing with text ambiguity and classifying four types of hate speech, namely, religion, race, disability, and sexual orientation-and compare its performance with those popular methods as well as some existing fuzzy approaches, while the features are prepared through the bag-of-words and word embedding feature extraction methods alongside the correlation-based feature subset selection method. The experimental results show that the proposed fuzzy method outperforms the other methods in most cases.",0

Sentiment Analysis can be defined as the process of analyzing online pieces of writing to determine the emotional tone they carry. With the vast growth of the social media content on the Internet in the past few years, people now express their opinion on almost anything in discussion. With respect to this, Bag of Words (BoW) is the most popular way to model text in statistical machine learning (ML) approaches. However, the performance of BoW sometimes remains unlimited due to some fundamental deficiencies in handling the polarity shift problem and other few challenges like quality of the opinions, hidden state representations, polarity categorization etc. To come across these challenges our focus will be on Dual Sentiment Analysis which processes the Sentiment with all the perspectives (positive, negative or neutral). This may lead towards the accurate prediction for final decision making based on the reviews given by the customers. The proposed work is being experimented on the Amazon Product reviews specifically the Mobile device reviews.

However, due to the long-distance dependency and polysemy, existing text matching models cannot effectively capture the contextual and implicit semantic information of texts. Additionally, existing models are lack of generalization ability when applied to different scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel Deep Interactive Text Matching (DITM) model by integrating the encoder layer, the co-attention layer, and the fusion layer as an interaction module, based on a matching-aggregation framework. In particular, the interaction process is iterated multiple times to obtain the in-depth interaction information, and the relationship between the text pair is extracted through the multi-perspective pooling. We conduct extensive experiments on four text matching tasks, i.e., opinion retrieval, answer selection, paraphrase identification and natural language inference. Compared with the state-of-the-art text matching methods, the proposed model achieved the best results on most of the tasks, which proves that our model could effectively capture the interactive information between text pairs, and has a high generalization ability among different tasks. Further multi-lingual investigations show the similarities of the performance between English and Chinese, which suggest that our model could be ported to other languages. The research contributes a simple and efficient implementation of text matching in a situation where there is limited computing capacity, and sheds light on leveraging text matching models to facilitate a range of downstream tasks.",1

Since there is no contact with the product, people have to rely on the description of the seller, knowing that sometimes it may be biased and not entirely true. Therefore, review systems emerged to provide more trustworthy sources of information, since customer opinions may be less biased. However, the need to control the consumers' opinion increased once sellers realized the importance of reviews and their direct impact on sales. One of the methods often used was to offer customers a specific product in exchange for an honest review. Yet, these incentivized reviews bias results and skew the overall rating of the products. The current study uses a data mining approach to predict whether or not a new review published was incentivized based on several review features such as the overall rating, the helpfulness rate, and the review length, among others. Additionally, the model was enriched with sentiment score features of the reviews computed through the VADER algorithm. The results provide an in-depth understanding of the phenomenon by identifying the most relevant features which enable to differentiate an incentivized from a non-incentivized review, thus providing users and companies with a simple set of rules to identify reviews that are biased without any disclaimer. Such rules include the length of a review, its helpfulness rate, and the overall sentiment polarity score.",1

Social media has become a bedrock for people to voice their opinions worldwide. Due to the greater sense of freedom with the anonymity feature, it is possible to disregard social etiquette online and attack others without facing severe consequences, inevitably propagating hate speech. The current measures to sift the online content and offset the hatred spread do not go far enough. One factor contributing to this is the prevalence of regional languages in social media and the paucity of language flexible hate speech detectors. The proposed work focuses on analyzing hate speech in Hindi-English code-switched language. Our method explores transformation techniques to capture precise text representation. To contain the structure of data and yet use it with existing algorithms, we developed 'MoH' or (Map Only Hindi), which means 'Love' in Hindi. 'MoH' pipeline which consists of language identification, Roman to Devanagari Hindi transliteration using a knowledge base of Roman Hindi words, and finally employs the fine-tuned Multilingual Bert, and MuRIL language models. We conducted several quantitative experiment studies on three datasets, and evaluated performance using Precision, Recall and F1 metrics. The first experiment studies 'MoH' mapped text's performance with classical machine learning models and shows an average increase of 13% in F1 scores. The second compares the proposed work's scores with those of the baseline models and shows a rise in performance by 6%. Finally, the third compares the proposed 'MoH' technique with various data simulations using the existing transliteration library. Here, 'MoH' outperforms the rest by 15%.

"16076","Sentiment Analysis on Microblogging with K-Means Clustering and Artificial Bee Colony","Orkphol, Korawit; Yang, Wu",2019,"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND APPLICATIONS","Article","Microblogging is a type of blog used by people to express their opinions, attitudes, and feelings toward entities with a short message and this message is easily shared through the network of connected people. Knowing their sentiments would be beneficial for decision-making, planning, visualization, and so on. Grouping similar microblogging messages can convey some meaningful sentiments toward an entity. This task can be accomplished by using a simple and fast clustering algorithm, K-means. As the microblogging messages are short and noisy they cause high sparseness and high-dimensional dataset. To overcome this problem, term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) technique is employed for selecting the relevant features, and singular value decomposition (SVD) technique is employed for reducing the high-dimensional dataset while still retaining the most relevant features. These two techniques adjust dataset to improve the K-means efficiently. Another problem comes from K-means itself. K-means result relies on the initial state of centroids, the random initial state of centroids usually causes convergence to a local optimum. To find a global optimum, artificial bee colony (ABC), a novel swarm intelligence algorithm, is employed to find the best initial state of centroids. Silhouette analysis technique is also used to find optimal K. After clustering into K groups, each group will be scored by SentiWordNet and we analyzed the sentiment polarities of each group. Our approach shows that combining various techniques (i.e., tf-idf, SVD, and ABC) can significantly improve K-means result (41% from normal K-means).",1

Automatic analysis of such corpus requires enhanced developed algorithms based on natural language processing and opinion mining. Moreover, the linguistic differences make extending existing algorithms from one language to another challenging and in some cases impossible. Opinion mining focuses on different subjects of review analysis such as spam detection, aspect elicitation and polarity allocation. In this article, we focus on detection of explicit aspect and propose a methodology to overcome some difficult and problematic aspect compounds in the form of multi- words format in Persian language. Our approach proposes the construction of a directed weighted graph (ADG structure) based on some yielded information from FP-Growth frequent pattern identification algorithm on our corpus of Persian sentence. Traversing some special paths within the ADG graph according to our developed rules could lead us to the extraction of problematic multi-word aspects. We utilize Neo4j NoSQL graph database environment and its Cypher query language in order to create the ADG graph and access the desired paths that reflects our developed rules on the ADG structure which lead us to extract the multi-word aspects. The evaluation of our methodology with the existing approaches on the issue of aspect derivation in Persian language including ELDA, SAM, an MMI-based and an LRT-based algorithms indicates the robustness of our approach.",0

The method consists of (1) identifying more reliable topic sets through repeated latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and clustering; and (2) classifying tweets using topics based on an existing theory for service quality. The method is applied to tweets on the quality of NHS of the UK to demonstrate its usability. We measured social perceptions of healthcare service quality and identified keywords for each SERVQUAL dimension. Moreover, a comparison between the social perceptions derived from the tweets and traditional survey result on the same service quality shows the similarity which confirms the usability of the proposed method.

In social media, users can easily express their opinions and evaluation regarding products or services. These online user experiences, especially negative evaluations indeed affect other consumers' behaviors. Consequently, to effectively identify customers' sentiments and avoid these negative comments to bring a great damage to enterprisers has become one of critical issues. In recent years, machine learning algorithms were viewed as one of effective solutions for sentiment classification. But, when the amount of the online reviews arises, the dimensionality of text data rises remarkably. The performances of machine learning methods have been degraded due to the dimensionality problem. But, conventional feature selection methods tend to select attributes from the majority sentiments, which usually cannot improve classification performance. Therefore, this study attempt to present two feature selection methods called modified categorical proportional difference (MCPD) approach that improves conventional CPD method, and balance category feature (BCF) strategy that equally selects attributes from both positive and negative examples, to improve sentiment classification performances. Finally, several real sentiment cases of text reviews will be provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Results showed that the combination of proposed BCF strategy and MCPD method can not only remarkably reduce feature space, but also improve the sentiment classification performance.",0

It aims to automatically evaluate the sentiment polarity. Several methods and tools have been developed to address this issue which is more difficult in a bilingual context, such as the case of Senegal where the official French language is often mixed with Wolof the national language. [1] has been recently proposed as effective solutions for overcoming the complexities of this bilingual sentiment analysis. The lemmatizer-methods used there are based respectively on word-level similarity and the word-level trigrams (list of consecutive three letters) to convert inflectional forms and derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form. This morphological analysis approach is very complex and has some limitations for normalizing some words because French words are morphologically complex. Furthermore, the lemmatization of Wolof words is very difficult to implement because they are written using the French alphabet. In addition, these previous approaches use Bayes independence assumption to determine the sentiment of a sentence. This is another limitation when considering syntactic rules in a linguistic expression. To overcome these drawbacks and address the challenges and opportunities of bilingual sentiment analysis, we propose: (i) a French-Wolof dictionary and dictionary-based lemmatizer for better deal with verbs' conjugation or some words' declination in both languages, and (ii) a method for determining context dependent sentiment words based on Markov Model. Experimental conducted on a more larger data [2], shows that it successfully predicts sentiment polarity with an accuracy of 0.94 (implying an increase of 21% compared to the previous work).  © 2023 IEEE.",0

To understand commonalities and differences between social expectations and academic research, we analyzed the relationship between sentiment polarity appearing in news articles and topical coverage of academic publications. We found that news discourse is shifting from a prevailing positive view towards a more neutral stance in recent years. However, the sentiment and levels of attention vary widely depending on the specific topic being covered. When topics in the news are compared to those in academic articles, news coverage leans towards applied academic research. Also, highly similar topics in both news and academic publishing tend to appear earlier as a social discussion when expressing a positive sentiment. We discuss these findings in the contexts of science communication and transdisciplinary research.",1

This is the first study to report the results of using SML to understand patients' experiences of living with dry eye disease (DED). Methods Publicly available, English-language social media content between December 2016 and August 2017 was searched employing pre-defined criteria using Social Studio (R), an online aggregator-tool for posts from social media channels. Using natural language processing (NLP), posts were indexed using patient lexicon and disease-related keywords to derive a set of patient posts. NLP was used to identify relevance, followed by further manual evaluation and analysis to generate patient insights. Results In all, 2279 possible patient records were identified following NLP, which were filtered for relevance to disease area by analysts, resulting in a total of 1192 posts which formed the basis of this study. Of these, 77% (n = 915) were from the USA. Symptoms, causes, diagosis and treatments were the most commonly discussed themes. Most common symptoms mentioned were eye dryness (138/901), pain (114/901) and blurry vision (110/901). Pharmaceutical drugs (prescription and over-the-counter; 55%; 764/1393), followed by medical devices (20%; 280/1393), were mentioned as major options for managing symptoms. Of the pharmaceutical drugs, eye drops (33%; 158/476) and artificial tears (10%; 49/476) were the most common over-the-counter options reported, and Restasis (R) (22%; 103/476) and Xiidra (R) (6%; 27/476) were the most common prescription drugs. Patients voiced a significant impact of DED on their daily activities (4%; 9/224), work (23%; 51/224) and driving (12%; 26/224). Lack of DED specialists, standard diagnostic procedures, effective treatment options and need to increase awareness of DED among patients were identified as the key unmet needs. Conclusions Insights revealed using SML strengthen our understanding about patient experiences and their unmet needs in DED. This study illustrates that an SML approach contributed effectively in generating patient insights, which can be utilised to inform early drug development process, market access strategies and stakeholder discussions. Funding Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland. Plain Language Summary Plain language summary available for this article. Plain Language Summary Dry eye disease (DED) is a chronic health condition that affects a large number of people. The effects of DED can cause many problems in the lives of patients. Social media listening is an upcoming methodology which lends itself to researching how diseases can affect patients, by looking at what people discuss in online social media forums about their disease. The thoughts and opinions expressed openly by patients online distinguish this approach from traditional, structured and solicited patient research, and it is considered that the results of such social media listening studies should reflect spontaneous patient perspectives on their disease. In this study, patients' internet social media posts about DED were identified using software through a keyword search and further analysed. It was found that most DED patients talked about their symptoms, causes, diagnosis and treatments when discussing DED. Most patients said they experienced eye dryness, pain and blurry vision. Daily activities like work and driving were all greatly affected by DED. Concerning what would make things better for them, patients mentioned the need for standard methods of diagnosing DED, better treatment options and need for a better awareness of the disease. Emotions expressed tended to be very negative, reflective of the impact of the disease on their lives. This study illustrates how DED negatively affects the lives of patients and highlights their unmet needs; it may help doctors, pharmaceutical companies and health insurance providers better understand the challenges faced by patients with this disease.",0
"16928","Investigating the opinions distribution in the controversy on social media","Qiu, Jiangtao; Lin, Zhangxi; Shuai, Qinghong",2019,"INFORMATION SCIENCES","Article","The research works that investigate controversies on social media seek to answer questions such as the following: Is the topic controversial? What opinions do the users hold? What is the size of each opinion group? Researchers can learn public points of view through the lens of the controversy. Unlike prior work, this study intends to investigate the distribution of opinions in the controversy via sentiments hidden behind rich user-generated content that is produced from interactions among users. To meet the challenge, this study develops an analytical framework that combines social network analysis and sentiment analysis. The framework constructs an emotional social network from replies and retweets on social media, and subsequently employs the simulated annealing algorithm to partition nodes in the network into three emotional factions, including proponent, opponent and neutral groups. Consequently, an opinion distribution in the controversy can be built. The framework also allows calculating a score based on the distribution to measure the controversy. We conducted experiments on a public dataset and a synthetic dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the framework can perform the task well. We also employed the framework to explore Chinese movies and obtained several interesting findings, which include the following: (1) Both the very high-rated movies and the very low-rated movies have much lower controversy. (2) Almost all of the high box-office movies have high controversy. (3) A dominant positive image and high controversy are two salient characteristics of the high box-office movies.

It aims to extract the corresponding opinion words for a given opinion target in a review sentence. Intuitively, the relation between an opinion target and an opinion word mostly relies on syntactics. In this study, we design a directed syntactic dependency graph based on a dependency tree to establish a path from the target to candidate opinions. Subsequently, we propose a novel attention-based relational graph convolutional neural network (ARGCN) to exploit syntactic information over dependency graphs. Moreover, to explicitly extract the corresponding opinion words toward the given opinion target, we effectively encode target information in our model with the target-aware representation. Empirical results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms all of the existing models on four benchmark datasets.

Methods: Twitter data (N = 82,893) related to both older adults and COVID-19 and dated from January 23 to May 20, 2020, were analyzed. We used a combination of data science methods (including supervised machine learning, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis), qualitative thematic analysis, and conventional statistics. Results: The most common category in the coded tweets was personal opinions (66.2%), followed by informative (24.7%), jokes/ridicule (4.8%), and personal experiences (4.3%). The daily average of ageist content was 18%, with the highest of 52.8% on March 11, 2020. Specifically, more than 1 in 10 (11.5%) tweets implied that the life of older adults is less valuable or downplayed the pandemic because it mostly harms older adults. A small proportion (4.6%) explicitly supported the idea of just isolating older adults. Almost three-quarters (72.9%) within jokes/ridicule targeted older adults, half of which were death jokes. Also, 14 themes were extracted, such as perceptions of lockdown and risk. A bi-variate Granger causality test suggested that informative tweets regarding at-risk populations increased the prevalence of tweets that downplayed the pandemic. Discussion: Ageist content in the context of COVID-19 was prevalent on Twitter. Information about COVID-19 on Twitter influenced public perceptions of risk and acceptable ways of controlling the pandemic. Public education on the risk of severe illness is needed to correct misperceptions.",1

Automatically inferring the states or needs of learners from their posts is of interest to instructors, who are faced with a high attrition in MOOCs. Machine learning has previously been successfully used to identify states such as confusion or posting questions, but no solution has yet been provided so that instructors can track the progress of the learners using a validated framework from education research. In this paper, we develop a model to automatically label a post based on the first phase of the interaction analysis model (IAM). This allows instructors to automatically identify whether students are stating opinions, clarifying details, or engaging in activities such as providing examples to peers. Our model is tested on a Coursera MOOC devoted to Chemistry, for which we are able to correctly categorize the IAM status in 4 out of 5 posts. Our approach thus provides instructors with an intelligent system that generates actionable learning assessment data and can cope with large enrollment. Using the system, instructors can quickly identify and remedy learning issues, thus supporting learners in attaining their intended outcomes.",0

Particularly, in Italy, there is a lively discussion on the web regarding vaccines also because there is low vaccination coverage, vaccines hesitancy, and anti-vaccine movements. For these reasons, in 2017, Institutions have introduced a law to force children to make ten compulsory vaccines for school attendance and proposed a vaccination campaign. On social networks, this law has fostered a fierce discussion between pro-vaccinations and anti-vaccinations people. This paper aims to understand if and how the population's opinion has changed before the law and after the vaccination campaign using the titles of the videos uploaded on Youtube in these periods. Method Using co-occurrence network (CON) and sentiment analysis, we analysed the topics of YouTube Italian videos on vaccines in 2017 and 2018. Results The CON confirms that vaccinations were very disapproved before the law. Instead, after the communication campaign, people start to be less critical. The sentiment analysis shows that the intense vaccination campaign also promoted by medical doctors pushed the sentiment to change polarity from a prevailing negative opinion in 2017 (52% negative) to a positive one in 2018 (54% positive). Conclusion At the population level, the potential misinformation of social networks could be significant and is a real risk for health. Our study highlights that vaccination campaigns on social networks could be an essential instrument of health policies and a sharp weapon to fight ignorance and misrepresentations of non-qualified people influencing individuals' decision-making.",1

Their responses are related to mindfulness, which is a novel technique used to control stress and anxiety caused by different factors in daily life. As such, we proposed an online course where this method was applied in order to improve the quality of life of health care professionals in COVID 19 pandemic times. We also carried out an evaluation of the satisfaction level of the participants involved, with a view to establishing strategies to improve future experiences. To automatically perform this task, we used Natural Language Processing (NLP) models such as swivel embedding, neural networks, and transfer learning, so as to classify the inputs into the following three categories: negative, neutral, and positive. Due to the limited amount of data available-86 registers for the first and 68 for the second-transfer learning techniques were required. The length of the text had no limit from the user's standpoint, and our approach attained a maximum accuracy of 93.02% and 90.53%, respectively, based on ground truth labeled by three experts. Finally, we proposed a complementary analysis, using computer graphic text representation based on word frequency, to help researchers identify relevant information about the opinions with an objective approach to sentiment.

Each post and comment can give an insight into valuable information about a certain topic or issue, a product or a brand, etc. Similarly, the process to uncover the underlying information from the opinion that a person keeps about any entity is called a sentiment analysis. The analysis can be carried out through two main approaches, i.e., either lexicon-based or machine learning algorithms. A significant amount of work in the different domains has been done in numerous languages for sentiment analysis, but minimal research has been conducted on the national language of Pakistan, which is Urdu. Twitter users who are familiar with Urdu update the tweets in two different textual formats either in Urdu Script (Nastaleeq) or in Roman Urdu. Thus, the paper is an attempt to perform the sentiment analysis on the Urdu language by extracting the tweets (Nastaleeq and Roman Urdu both) from Twitter using Tweepy APL A machine learning-based approach has been adopted for this study and the tool opted for the purpose is WEKA. The best algorithm was identified based on evaluation metrics, which comprise the number of correctly and incorrectly classified instances, accuracy, precision, and recall. SMO was found to be the most suitable machine learning algorithm for performing the sentiment analysis on Urdu (Nastaleeq) tweets, while the Roman Urdu Random Forest algorithm was identified as the best one.",1

In aspect level, the aim is to determinate the target of sentiment or opinion represented in customer reviews, known as aspect term identification. In this paper, we address the aspect identification task involving implicit aspect implied by adjectives and verbs. Our approach considers the training data enhancement for Naive Bayes (NB) classifier through the use of synonym and definition relations from WordNet (WN). In our method, we use the two semantic relations differently. NB classifier was used with five unique subsets of synonym and definition words and applied on two benchmark datasets, products reviews and restaurant. The obtained results show that: (1) The use of synonym and definition relations as represented in our work supports NB classifier and (2) Synonym and Definition relation must be appropriately combined the used to better support each implicit aspect identification task involving adjectives and verbs.",1

Various vaccines such as Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Sinovac, CanSino, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, and Sinopharm have been approved by WHO. All countries agree that the vaccination process will significantly reduce the number of Covid-19 infectious. This study discusses the impact of the vaccination over the confirmed, recovered, and deaths cases by using machine learning, particularly the Support Vector Regression (SVR). Based on the data from February 2021 to August 2021, we predict 3 cases of confirmed, recovered, and deaths in Malaysia. This study also looked at the trend of the three cases where no vaccines were introduced in Malaysia, but a restriction called the Movement Controlled Order (MCO) period was applied. Since we found some pros and cons of vaccination in Malaysia, which may affect the confirmed cases, we then use artificial neural networks (ANN) to do sentiment analysis of the social opinion regarding the vaccination in Malaysia. It involves gathering about 1000 tweets-collecting data from the tweets keyword """"vaksin Malaysia"""". The results showed that the accuracy of Covid-19 predictions was above 90% of R2 during the vaccination process and the MCO period, and based on the results of sentiment analysis, and it was shown that about 88% of people tend to accept the vaccine positively compared to 8% who accept negatively. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Sentiment analysis usually concentrates to classify the opinion of whole document or sentence. However, in most comments, users often express their opinions on different aspects of the mentioned entity rather than express general sentiments on entire document. In this case, using aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a solution. ABSA emphases on extracting and synthesizing sentiments on particular aspects of entities in opinion text. The previous studies have difficulty working with aspect extraction and sentiment polarity classification in multiple domains of review. We offer an innovative deep learning approach with the integrated construction of bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for multidomain ABSA in this article. Our system finished the following tasks: domain classification, aspect extraction and opinion determination of aspect in the document. Besides applying GloVe word embedding for input sentences from mixed Laptop_Restaurant domain of the SemEval 2016 dataset, we also use the additional layer of POS to pick out the word morphological attributes before feeding to the CNN_BiLSTM architecture to enhance the flexibility and precision of our suggested model. Through experiment, we found that our proposed model has performed the above mentioned tasks of domain classification, aspect and sentiment extraction concurrently on a mixed domain dataset and achieved the positive results compared to previous models that were performed only on separated domain dataset.",1

While a dichotomous stance based on the superiority of one over the other is commonly found in the existing literature, this study takes a business ecosystem approach to shed light on the distinct yet complementary roles played by experts and by the public within the overall system. Their relative impacts are compared in multiple areas such as quality ratings, price, and closure of restaurants. Data on 866 restaurants in France, Germany, and the UK collected from the Michelin Guide Main Cities of Europe 2018 edition and TripAdvisor's website (accessed in 2019) are analyzed. Two contrasting phenomena are found: First, quality rating and price are positively associated with expert reviews, but negatively related with public reviews. Second, restaurant closure is strongly impacted by public reviews, whereas expert reviews exert a relatively weaker influence in this area. These findings indicate that experts and the public have complementary roles and support the value of taking an ecosystem approach to the changing environment in the restaurant business, given that the reputation of restaurants is indeed anchored on experts but business sustainability relies on public opinion.",0

However, the increasing number of comments makes it increasingly difficult to understand customers using manual methods. To solve this problem, this study builds a hybrid research model based on aspect mining and comment classification for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) to deeply comprehend the customer and their experiences. Based on previous classification results, we first construct a dictionary of positive and negative words in the e-commerce field. Then, the POS tagging technique is applied for word classification in Vietnamese to extract aspects of model commerce related to positive or negative words. The model is implemented with machine and deep learning methods on a corpus comprising more than 1,000,000 customer opinions collected from Vietnam's four largest mobile commerce applications. Experimental results show that the Bi-LSTM method has the highest accuracy with 92.01%; it is selected for the proposed model to analyze the viewpoint of words on real data. The findings are that the proposed hybrid model can be applied to monitor online customer experience in real time, enable administrators to make timely and accurate decisions, and improve the quality of products and services to take a competitive advantage. © 2023, Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.

As suggested by the original authors, these assessments are done by interviewing stakeholders and asking them about the level of satisfaction if a certain feature is well implemented and the level of dissatisfaction if a feature is not or not well implemented. [Question/problem] Assessments via interviews are time-consuming, expensive, and can only capture the opinion of a limited set of stakeholders. [Principal ideas/results] We investigate the possibility to extract Kano model factors (basic needs, performance factors, delighters, irrelevant) from a large set of user feedback (i.e., app reviews). We implemented, trained, and tested several classifiers on a set of 2,592 reviews. In a 10-fold cross-validation, a BERT-based classifier performed best with an accuracy of 92.8%. To assess the classifiers’ generalization, we additionally tested them on another independent set of 1,622 app reviews. The accuracy of the best classifier dropped to 72.5%. We also show that misclassifications correlate with human disagreement on the labels.

Specifically, we examined tweets generated after former U.S. President Donald Trump retweeted misinformation about the drug using an unsupervised machine learning approach called the biterm topic model that is used to cluster tweets into misinformation topics based on textual similarity. The top 10 tweets from each topic cluster were content coded for three types of misinformation categories related to scientific authority: medical endorsements of hydroxychloroquine, scientific information used to support hydroxychloroquine's use, and a comparison group that included scientific evidence opposing hydroxychloroquine's use. Results show a much higher volume of tweets featuring medical endorsements and use of supportive scientific information compared to accurate and updated scientific evidence, that misinformation-related tweets propagated for a longer time frame, and the majority of hydroxychloroquine Twitter discourse expressed positive views about the drug. Metadata from Twitter accounts found that prominent users within misinformation discourse were more likely to have media or political affiliation and explicitly expressed support for President Trump. Conversely, prominent accounts within the scientific opposition discourse primarily consisted of medical doctors or scientists but had far less influence in the Twitter discourse. Implications of these findings and connections to related social media research are discussed, as well as cognitive mechanisms for understanding susceptibility to misinformation and strategies to combat misinformation spread via online platforms.",0

Past research has shown that social media is a useful tool for collecting data about public opinion and conducting analysis of air pollution. In contrast to statistical sampling based on survey approaches, data retrieved from social media can provide direct information about behavior and capture long-term data being generated by the public. However, there is a lack of studies on how to mine social media to gain valuable insights into the public's pro-environmental behavior. Therefore, research is needed to integrate information retrieved from social media sites into an established theoretical framework on environmental behaviors. Thus, the aim of this paper is to construct a theoretical model by integrating social media mining into a value-belief-norm model of public concerns about air pollution. We propose a hybrid method that integrates text mining, topic modeling, hierarchical cluster analysis, and partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). We retrieved data regarding public concerns about air pollution from social media sites. We classified the topics using hierarchical cluster analysis and interpreted the results in terms of the value-belief-norm theoretical framework, which encompasses egoistic concerns, altruistic concerns, biospheric concerns, and adaptation strategies regarding air pollution. Then, we used PLS-SEM to confirm the causal relationships and the effects of mediation. An empirical study based on the concerns of Taiwanese social media users about air pollution was used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework in general and to examine gender differences in particular. Based on the results of the empirical studies, we confirmed the robust effects of egoistic, altruistic, and biospheric concerns of public impact on adaptation strategies. Additionally, we found that gender differences can moderate the causal relationship between egoistic concerns, altruistic concerns, and adaptation strategies. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of enhancing perceptions of air pollution and environmental sustainability by the public. The results of the analysis can serve as a basis for environmental policy and environmental education strategies.",1

However, most existing methods for the task cannot capture the long-range contextual information in an utterance and a conversation effectively. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel hierarchical attention network with residual gated recurrent unit framework. Firstly, we adopt the pre-trained BERT-Large model to obtain context-dependent representation for each token of each utterance in a conversation. Then, a hierarchical attention network is proposed to capture long-range contextual information about the conversation structure. Besides, in order to better model position information of the utterances in a conversation, we add position embedding to the input of the multi-head attention.

The proposed method adopts lexicon-based text mining technology to extract the failure-related customer knowledge from product users' online reviews. Using the information on the symptom and time of each failure experienced by customers, we classify the failure for each component and analyze the reliability using the estimated parameters of failure distributions. A comparative analysis is proposed to eliminate the uncertainty accompanying the review information. The application of the proposed framework is demonstrated by a case study of two similar mobile phone products.

As a method of this category, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) estimates the semantic relations between the words of the text effectively and can play an important role in solving various issues, including emotional analysis in combination with other parameters. In this study, three novel topic models called date sentiment LDA (DSLDA), author-date sentiment LDA (ADSLDA), and pack-author-date sentiment LDA (PADSLDA) are proposed. The proposed models extend LDA through some extra parameters such as date, author, helpfulness, sentiment, and subtopic. The proposed models use helpfulness in the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Helpfulness is a part of readers who found the review helpful. The proposed models divide the words into two categories: the words more affected by the distribution of subtopic and the words more affected by the main topic. In this study, a new concept called pack is introduced, and a new model called PADSLDA is proposed for sentiment analysis at pack level.

However, the simple rating information cannot provide users with more detailed reasons for recommendations in the explanation. To encode more sentiment information, some methods introduce user opinions into the explanations. As the opinion-based explainable recommendation system does not utilize supervision from sentiment, the generated explanations are generally limited to templates. To solve these issues, we propose a model called Sentiment-opinion Alignment Explainable Recommendation (SAER), which combines sentiment and opinion to ensure that the opinion in the explanation is consistent with the user's sentiment to the product. Moreover, SAER provides informative explanations with diverse opinions for recommended items.

But what does this bode for the convergence of global culture? Here we explore the relationship between centralization in social networks and contraction or collapse in the diversity of semantic expressions such as ideas, opinions and tastes. We advance formal examination of this relationship by introducing new methods of manifold learning that allow us to map social networks and semantic combinations into comparable hyperbolic spaces. Hyperbolic representations natively represent both hierarchy and diversity within a system. In a Poincare disk-a two-dimensional hyperbolic embedding-radius from center traces the position of an actor in a social hierarchy or an idea in a semantic hierarchy. Angle of the disk required to inscribe connected actors or ideas captures their diversity. We illustrate this method by examining the relationship between social centralization and semantic diversity within 21st Century physics, empirically demonstrating how dense, centralized collaboration is associated with a reduction in the space of ideas and how these patterns generalize to all modern scholarship and science. We discuss the complex of causes underlying this association, and theorize the dynamic interplay between structural centralization and semantic contraction, arguing that it introduces an essential tension between the supply and demand of difference.",0

It is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that decides whether a text expresses positive or negative sentiment. Web contents are increasing rapidly and providing a huge number of information. It is an important research issue to analyze and organize these enormous information for better knowledge extraction. In this paper, we emphasis on opinion mining for Bangla text using web based diverse data. We apply both Linear and Nonlinear Support Vector Machine as machine learning technique and N-gram method to classify Bangla documents collected from social media sites. Most of works in this arena take a single word as a vector. Instead of thinking a single word as a vector, we used one vector containing more than one words using N-gram. N-grams of texts are extensively used in text mining and natural language processing tasks. We found better results using N-grams for different values of n.",1
"869","The Mediating Manager for Effective Troubleshooting in Organizations: A Transdisciplinary View from HPTD-M","da Costa, Leonardo da Silva Guimarães Martins (57455993300)",2023,"Transdisciplinary Journal of Engineering and Science","Article","This article proposes the idea of mediating manager, as wel l as the analytical and the synthetic model of quaternary complementarities of the HPTD-M theory (Holopraxis Transdisciplinary Management), published throughout 2022 and 2023. In the context of the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance), the view of transdisciplinarity (TD) in public management and general management is developed, including concepts of governance and governability with the types of leadership. The MBTI system of self-leadership and management within the HPTD-M synthetic model is explained, an innovation presented by HPTD-M for classification in four epistemic ways or quadrants. The mechanistic, systemic, TD, and HPTD-M paradigms are described as instruments for effective troubleshooting. Final ly, the HPTD-M model developed from Jung’s Analytical Psychology with concrete examples: Shadow levels of the col lective unconscious. The results of this text publication may eventual ly start a new vision of training for managers, having in mind the perspective of ESG, of not only to public managers but also project managers (for planning and strategic planning purposes), besides business managers in state-owned companies, i.e., this article can be applied to public and private organizations. This is the idea of the mediating and TD leader, under the holopraxis dialectical perspective for effective problem-solving. Management problems cannot be solved only with mechanisms because human phenomena are much more complex than mechanical, biological, and ecological issues, even in a systemic vision, hence the TD paradigm as a way of approaching the experienced reality, while considering the mechanistic and systemic paradigms, when applied as a simpler way of solving problems. Final ly, the training for the mediating manager seems to be compatible with courses that simulate work groups concretely, especial ly through the instructor’s behavior, so that conflicts and distinct opinions build solutions through maieutics. This method of eliciting knowledge by a series of questions and answers forms the dialectics of abstract ideas to be shaped in solutions discussed concretely, through a feedback cycle between the concrete and the abstract, starting from the synthetic method, in the scope of the deductive and inductive method, which provoke questions to bring back doubts to the abstract field, until the cycle stresses itself to reach simplified and effective solutions. This formula can work not only for management training but also for courses envisaging academics and practitioners of TD interested in understanding transdisciplinary mediation. © 2023, ATLAS.

To this end, the study proposed a data-driven support and decision model (DSDM) that uses a mixed methodology (qualitative and quantitative) to analyze data collected from different writing centers and coaching programs who responded to an online survey that comprised of both quantitative and qualitative items. Quantitatively, we applied a Linear and Mixed-effect logistic regression analysis to investigate the critical factors that motivate the users in seeking educational support services. And, qualitatively apply the Text mining technique to analyze the opinions given by the participants in order to establish its level of impact towards the several services offered by the coaching programs. Theoretically, the proposed research model is grounded on integration of a data-structure approach that builds on the descriptive decision theory; which studies the rationality of the decisions that users are disposed to make by means of the statistical method and textual data quantification. In turn, the method allowed us to capture the influential factors and state-of-the-art in faculties-students development and coaching programs, and to provide solutions to the ever-increasing need to improve educational supporting services and quality in a competitive and rapidly changing educational environment or market that have not been done before. Although there may be a considerable variation between the different categories of educational services offered by the coaching centers. The results of our study shows that the users hold services such as tutoring as a major factor that influences their visit and recommendations to the writing centers or coaching programs. Moreover, most users of the coaching programs are motivated by the need to gain support with their educational/academic performance and productivity.",0

This program covers several types of mass transportation in Jakarta such as Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), Light Rail Transit (LRT), Electric Train (KRL Commuter Line), and Bus Transjakarta (TJ). In hope, the people will be interested to switch their modes of transportation to using public transportation considering the congestion and air pollution in Jakarta which is horrible. By utilizing data from twitter, this study tries to analyze public opinion on public transportation by classifying theirs opinions into positive & negative. Furthermore, topic modeling activites will be conducted using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method to find out topics that are often discussed publicly for each public transportation. It was found that the KRL is the only type of public transportation with the number of negative responses exceeding the number of positive responses. It was found that in the MRT & LRT, the community tended to mention words that had positive sentiments, whereas in KRL & TJ people tended to mention words that had negative sentiments. In the grouping of public opinion, the LDA model produced a topic of public discussion on public transportation that was different for each type of public transportation. The model can also capture public communication with the official account administration of public transportation. Prediction models obtained the lowest error with a Mean Average Percentage Error of 8.79%. By adding the public sentiment variable, it can improve the accuracy of the prediction model, but the tweets sentiment variable has no direct relationship to the variable number of public transportation users.

More and more researchers use text classification methods to identify law-related public opinion information. However, the existing text classification methods rely on labor-intensive feature engineering, and their performance mainly depends on information fusion and classification algorithms, which is unsuitable for rapidly developing fields. This paper extracts the user comments of a hunting forum to analyze the semantic information of argot and employs the Word2vec model to represent the argot feature. Combining the multi-layer information of the pre-trained BERT on the user comments, we propose a text classification method BERT_W2V_CRF to improve the classification efficiency of massive law-related public opinion texts. Specifically, we first build a terminology dictionary of Chinese hunting forum to identify the argot features in expert-marked data using the Word2vec model. Then the BERT model is pretrained and the representation of fused information is generated by combining the Word2vec and optimized BERT. Finally, the recognized result is obtained by using Softmax. Experiments are conducted on the user comment dataset to evaluate the proposed text classification method, and the results show that the information fusion approach can be used to improve the classification efficiency of the deep learning-based method.  © 2023 IEEE.",1

A line of reasoning is followed by providing evidence for the points made about the target concepts via aspects. Opinions on target concepts and opinions on aspects are used to support or attack the ideas expressed by target concepts and aspects. The relations between aspects, target concepts, opinions on target concepts and aspects are used to infer the argument relations. Propositions are connected iteratively to form a graph structure. The approach is generic in that it is not tuned for a specific corpus and evaluated on three different corpora from the literature: AAEC, AMT, US2016G1tv and achieved an F score of 0.79, 0.77 and 0.64, respectively.",1

In this work, we aim to understand the influence of workers' own opinions on their performance in the subjective task of bias detection. We analyze the influence of workers' opinions on their annotations corresponding to different topics. Our findings reveal that workers with strong opinions tend to produce biased annotations. We show that such bias can be mitigated to improve the overall quality of the data collected. Experienced crowd workers also fail to distance themselves from their own opinions to provide unbiased annotations.",0

As a technical application of data mining, text sentiment classification can be widely used in public opinion management, marketing, and other fields. In this study, a combination approach to SVM (support vector machine) and IPSO (improved particle swarm optimization) is proposed to classify sentiment by using text data. First, the text data of 30,000 goods reviews and corresponding ratings are collected through the web crawler. Then, TFIDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) and Word2vec are used to vectorize the goods review text data. Next, the proposed classification model is trained by the SVM, and the initial parameters of the SVM are optimized by the IPSO. Finally, we applied the trained SVM-IPSO model to the test set and evaluated the performance by several measures. Our experiment results indicate that the proposed model performed the best for text data sentiment classification. Additionally, the traditional machine learning model SVM becomes very effective after parameter optimization, which demonstrates that the parameters' optimization by IPSO has successfully improved the classification accuracy. Furthermore, our proposed model SVM-IPSO significantly outperforms other benchmark models, indicating that it could be applied to improve the accuracy and efficiency for text data sentiment classification.",1

Individuals' perceptions of the impact of weather can inform their adherence to public health guidelines; however, there is no measure of their perceptions. We quantified Twitter users' perceptions of the effect of weather and analyzed how they evolved with respect to real-world events and time. Materials and Methods: We collected 166,005 English tweets posted between January 23 and June 22, 2020 and employed machine learning/natural language processing techniques to filter for relevant tweets, classify them by the type of effect they claimed, and identify topics of discussion. Results: We identified 28,555 relevant tweets and estimate that 40.4 % indicate uncertainty about weather's impact, 33.5 % indicate no effect, and 26.1 % indicate some effect. We tracked changes in these proportions over time. Topic modeling revealed major latent areas of discussion. Discussion: There is no consensus among the public for weather's potential impact. Earlier months were characterized by tweets that were uncertain of weather's effect or claimed no effect; later, the portion of tweets claiming some effect of weather increased. Tweets claiming no effect of weather comprised the largest class by June. Major topics of discussion included comparisons to influenza's seasonality, President Trump's comments on weather's effect, and social distancing. Conclusion: We exhibit a research approach that is effective in measuring population perceptions and identifying misconceptions, which can inform public health communications.",1

Social opinion analyses helped determine the optimal public health response during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis of articulating tweets from Twitter can reveal the public's perceptions of social distance. Sentiment Analysis is used for classifying text data and analyzing people's emotions. The proposed work uses LSTM-RNN with the SMOTE method for categorizing Twitter data. The suggested approach uses increased characteristics weighted by attention layers and an LSTM-RNN-based network as its foundation. This method computes the advantage of an improved information transformation framework through the attention mechanism compared to existing BI-LSTM and LSTM models. A combination of four publicly accessible class labels such as happy, sad, neutral, and angry, is analyzed. The message of tweets is analyzed for polarization and subjectivity using TextBlob, VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), and SentiWordNet. The model has been successfully built and evaluated using two feature extraction methods, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Bag of Words (BoW). Compared to the previous methodologies, the suggested deep learning model improved considerably in performance measures, including accuracy, precision, and recall. This demonstrates how effective and practical the recommended deep learning strategy is and how simple it is to employ for sentiment categorization of COVID-19 reviews. The proposed method achieves 97% accuracy in classifying the text whereas, among existing Bi-LSTM, achieves 88% maximum in the text classification. © 2023 SCPE.",1

Based on 38,457 physicians' profiles from a popular online healthcare community in China, we used Latent Dirichlet Allocation model, which is a common topic model, to analyze the non-English text to obtain more doctor's latent characteristics. We found five of the most frequently mentioned topics. In addition to the first topic (doctor's academic rank and practice name), research ability, foreign experience, committee position, and clinical experience were included as unstructured descriptions in the doctor's profile. Inferences about physician ratings and page views could be improved if these themes were set as characteristics of physicians. Specifically, in our findings, Physicians' mentions of their research ability and foreign experience had a significant positive impact on physician ratings. Surprisingly, physicians mentioning more clinical experience had a significant negative impact on physician ratings. Moreover, while descriptions about foreign experience and committee position had a significant positive impact on page views, physician mentions of research ability had a significant negative impact on page views.

The application allows users to record and provide text reviews on tourist spots visited. Text reviews undergo parts-of-speech (POS) tagging, rule-based phrase chunking and dependency parsing to extract opinion phrases in noun-adjective and noun-verb pairs from the original text. Each pair is further classified to one of the four categories: accommodation, food, entertainment and tourist attraction using the noun against a curated bag-of-words (BOW) to ensure that only relevant statements are included in the scoring. Word Sense Disambiguation is performed to correctly identify the word sense that matches the meaning of the sentence using WordNet. SentiWordNet, a lexical resource for sentiment analysis, was used to determine polarity score representing the emotional intensity of the review. The system predicted star rating was compared with the actual author rating in Google Maps and with human annotator ratings who are asked to label the text reviews. The predicted rating scored low mean absolute error (MAE) between the system and human rating which means that the rating predicted is closer to human interpretation of the text reviews.

In general, customers express their reviews in natural language. It becomes a complex task when applying sentiment analysis on those reviews. In earlier stages, word-level features with various feature weighting methods such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec were applied for sentiment analysis and deep learning networks are not explored much. We considered phrase level and sentence level features instead of applying word-level features for sentiment analysis and also enhanced by applying various deep learning techniques. In this article, we have proposed a hybrid convolutional bidirectional recurrent neural network model (CBRNN) by combining two-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) with a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BGRU). In the proposed CBRNN model, the CNN layer extracts the rich set of phrase-level features and BGRU captures the chronological features through long term dependency in a multi-layered sentence. The proposed approach was evaluated on two benchmark datasets and compared with various baselines. The experimental results show that the proposed hybrid model provides better results than any other models with an F(1)score of 87.62% and 77.4% on IMDB and Polarity datasets,respectively. Our CBRNN model outperforms the state of the art by 2%-4% on these two datasets.

However, anthropogenic pressures challenge the existence of national parks and their conservation effectiveness. Therefore, it is crucial to assess how people perceive national parks in order to enhance socio-political support for conservation. User-generated data shared by visitors on social media provide opportunities to understand how people perceive (e.g. preferences, feelings, opinions) national parks during nature-based recreational experiences. In this study, we applied methods from automated natural language processing to assess visitors' sentiment when describing experiences in Instagram posts geolocated inside four national parks in South Africa. We found that visitors' sentiment was positive, and mostly included emotions such as joy, anticipation, trust and surprise, with only a small occurrence of posts with negative feelings. Appreciation of nature, in association with a diverse set of other aspects, such as activities, geographical features and tourist attractions, was used to describe experiences related to nature, wilderness, travelling, holidays and adventures. The type of nature-based experience described by visitors was park specific, revealing different profiles of parks providing wildlife or scenery experiences. Findings support and highlight the societal role of national parks in providing visitors with opportunities to develop positive connections with nature. Social media data may be used to understand visitors' perceptions, and how the image of national parks is constructed by users in the virtual social environment. This may help inform management for promoting a high-quality tourism experience, as well as conservation marketing aimed at fostering socio-political support for national parks and their long-term conservation effectiveness.

"15667","What social media activities reveal about election results? The use of Facebook during the 2015 general election campaign in Croatia","Babac, Marina Bagic; Podobnik, Vedran",2018,"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & PEOPLE","Article","Purpose Due to the significant rise in the use of social media in recent years, the purpose of this paper is to investigate who, how and why participates in creating content at political social networking websites utilising a content analysis of posts and comments published on Facebook during the 2015 general election campaign in Croatia. It shows consequences of a transition from traditional to social media campaigns and the effectiveness of social media at activating and moving public opinion during the general election campaign. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a data collection through a social media website, a classification of data set items by content attributes and a statistical analysis of the classified data. Findings Building on an empirical data set from Croatia, this study reveals that different political parties implement different election campaign strategies on social media to influence citizens who, consequently, respond differently to each of them. The results indicate that political messages with positive emotions evocate positive response from citizens, while neutral content is more likely to invoke negative comments and criticism, and support to the opponent. Another implication of the results is that two-way and tolerant communication of political actors increases citizen engagement, whereas unidirectional communication decreases it. Originality/value This paper provides an original insight into qualitative content analysis of posts and user comments published on Facebook during the 2015 general election campaign in Croatia.",0

It aims to assign the correct polarity to a given sentence considering the entity on which an opinion is expressed. Extant neural networks usually employ Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), or Attention networks to address the so-called target-sensitive sentiment problem, referring to the fact that sentence polarity is decided by aspect information and surrounding contexts jointly. However, those models usually are complicated and will incur tremendous training cost. Instead of using sophisticated sequential networks, we present a novel co-attention based network to capture the correlation between aspect and contexts. We evaluate our model on three public datasets and the results demonstrate a strong evidence of improved accuracy (up to 2.32% absolute improvement) and efficiency (model converges at least 4 times faster).",1

Companies sell their products and seek for consumer's feedback. When all the consumer writes their review about that's a product, It's becomes difficult to say that product is good or not based on their review. That's where Deep learning come. By using this, we can extract opinion or sentiment from the text which is written by the consumer. This is sentiment analysis. It can classify the emotional status of that review. Our project detects opinion from consumer's review whether it is good or bad. We use SVM, Naive Bayes algorithm and some methods. We use the Naive Bayes algorithm because we want to know how often words occur in the document. And then we use SVM for classifying whether words are positive or negative. For our researching purpose, we use the Amazon consumer review data set, which was available online. Some methods that we are using for preprocessing and cleaned the document where just words are left. We trained our model so well with twenty-four thousand data. So, it will give us the best accuracy and we make this model with the best algorithm and after that, it gives the accuracy of 98.39%.

Collaborative Filtering (CF) approach has been widely used to build recommender systems over the past decades. However, the performance of CF is limited by sparsity and cold start problems, which are very common in real world situations. In recent years, many review-based approaches have been developed to integrate textual reviews into recommendation process, since they provide much more information about item/user profiles than ratings. The use of text analysis and opinion mining methods helps extracting such information. In this paper, we first introduce standard CF techniques and their main challenges. Then, we present different kind of information that can be extracted from user reviews. After that, we describe recent works that exploit review elements to improve the CF-based recommendations.

This leads to a latter problem in which the fitted statistical model may not be able to produce correct and reliable estimates. Understanding the root of problem as to what is the main cause of the underreporting scenario is essential to assist on the decision making process in traffic accident analysis. In this study, 200 Malaysian drivers were interviewed on their sentiments towards this issue. Their opinions on the causes of underreporting scenario are investigated then assessed using text analyses. First, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation text modelling is employed to find the underlying themes in the reasons of not reporting a traffic accident. Then, the polarity of the topics is measured using a lexicon based sentiment analysis. Results showed that majority Malaysian drivers (80.5%) consider that reporting a minor or non-fatality accident is not important and can be neglected. The decision is due to the fact that of complicated and time consuming reporting process. The drivers are also asked on their opinion after the consequences of underreporting are informed to them. The polarity of their answers shifted to more positive in which 71% drivers will report an accident that occur in the future.",1

OPRs contain an enormous stockpile of information; therefore, it is difficult for potential customers to make a comprehensive evaluation of alternative products through qualitative reviews. To facilitate consumer purchase decisions, ranking the alternatives based on the OPRs posted on social media platforms is a worthwhile research topic, although relative study is comparatively rare. Therefore, this article provides an extended probabilistic linguistic TODIM (PL-TODIM) method for assisting potential customers to evaluate alternative products through consumer opinions regarding product performance. In other words, this study introduces a novel multiple attribute decision making (MADM) method to rank products based on OPRs. To realize this goal, some basic theories of probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) are reviewed. Moreover, a possibility formula is first proposed to compare the probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs). Furthermore, a combined weighting method is developed to determine objective weights based on cross entropy and entropy measures. Thus, the specific steps of the extended PL-TODIM method are described. After that step, in order to testify to the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method, a case study of OPRs for SUVs is designed.

A Case Study of Former US President Trump","Lin, Hsuan-Yu (Shane)",2022,"POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW","Article; Early Access","Does posting negative social media messages incur costs to politicians in a polarized society? While extant literature finds that politicians' negative rhetoric on social media increases audience engagement, this seemingly positive feedback from social media users will, in fact, amplify the real cost. Leveraging a YouGov dataset and applying Natural Language Processing techniques, I find novel evidence that negative social media messages by the political elite do generate tangible costs to the political elite. Negative rhetoric, while increasing the spread of information, negatively impacts the audience's evaluation of the content. This research also finds that the effect is mediated by policy topics. This research advances our understanding of the limitations of politicians' negative messaging on social media and contributes to the debate about the effect of politicians' negative social media communication, a growing political phenomenon in the United States and in democracies worldwide.",0

The character length limit in tweets encourages people to use emojis, emoticons and out of vocabulary words. Due to the huge volume of tweets being generated, it is difficult to manually label tweets and create a supervised learning model for sentiment analysis. Looking into these challenges, the research paper aims to create a feature level sentiment analysis model for Twitter data mining including features such as emoji detection, spelling correction and emoticon detection. The proposed model consists of automated training data labeling by using lexicon based approach. It is an ontology based system with the domain of Smartphone. In addition to the general lexicon used, a set of lexicons specific for each attribute of the domain Smartphone are used to improve classification accuracy for training data generation. This is used to classify tweets obtained about a particular mobile phone using SVM classifier. Experimental results show that the classifier based on automated training data provides good accuracy. It also demonstrates the importance of emoji detection and the attribute specific lexicons which help improve the classification accuracy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1

During the pandemic, large amounts of COVID-19-related tweets emerge every day. Real-time processing of daily tweets may offer insights for monitoring public opinion about intervention measures implemented. In this work, lockdown policy in New York State has been set as a target of public opinion research. This task includes two stages, stance detection and opinion monitoring. For the stance detection stage, we explored several combinations of different text representations and classification algorithms, finding that the combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) outperforms others. Due to the shortage of labeled data, we adopted the data distillation method for the training data augmentation. The augmentation of the training data allows to improve the performance of the model with a very small amount of manually-labeled data. After applying the distillation method, the accuracy of the model has been significantly improved. Utilizing the enhanced model, automatically classified tweets are analyzed over time to monitor the public opinion. By exploring the tweets in New York from January 22nd until September 30th, 2020, we show the correlation of public opinion with COVID-19 cases and mortality data, and the effect of government responses on the opinion shift.

The purpose of this paper is to develop guidelines for hotel service development by applying a service development approach integrating Kansei engineering and text mining. Design/methodology/approach The online reviews represent the voice of customers regarding the products and services. Consumers' online comments might become a key factor for consumers choosing hotels when planning their tourism itinerary. With the framework of Kansei engineering, this paper adopts text mining to extract the sets of Kansei words and hotel service characteristics from the online contents as well as the relationships among Kansei words, service characteristics and these two sets. The relationships are generated by using link analysis, and then the guidelines for hotel service development are proposed based on the obtained relationships. Findings The results of the present research can provide the hotel industry a comprehensive understanding of hotels' customers opinions, and can offer specific advice on how to differentiate one's products and services from competitors' in order to improve customer satisfaction and increase hotels' performance in the end. Finally, this study finds out the service development guidelines to meet customers' requirements which can provide suggestions for hotel managers. The implications both for academic and industry are also drawn based on the obtained results.

Techniques for aspect extraction can produce an undesirably large number of aspects with many of those relating to the same product feature. Hence, aspect clustering becomes necessary. Current solutions for aspect clustering are monolingual, but in many practical situations, reviews for a given entity are available in several languages, calling for multilingual integration. In this article, we address the novel task of multilingual aspect clustering, which aims at grouping semantically related aspects extracted from reviews written in several languages. Our method is unsupervised and relies on the contextual information of the aspects, which is represented by word embeddings. This representation allied with a suitable similarity measure allows clustering related aspects.

Opinion role labeling (ORL) is a task to extract opinion holder and target from natural language to answer the question who express what. Recent years, neural network based methods with additional lexical and syntactic features have achieved state-of-the-art performances in similar tasks. Moreover, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) has shown impressive performances among a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. To investigate BERT based end-to-end model in ORL, we propose models using BERT, Bidirectional Long short-term Memory (BILSTM) and Conditional Random Field (CRF) to jointly extract opinion roles (e.g., opinion holder and target). Experimental results show that our models achieve remarkable scores without using extra syntactic and/or semantic features. To our best knowledge, we are among the pioneers to successfully integrate BERT in this manner. Our work contributes to the improvement of state-of-the-art aspect-level opinion mining methods and providing strong baselines for future work.",1

As technology and understanding of emotion are progressing, it is necessary to design robust and reliable emotion recognition systems that are suitable for real-world applications both to enhance analytical abilities supporting human decision making and to design human & x2013;machine interfaces (HMI) that assist efficient communication. This paper presents a multimodal approach for speech emotion recognition based on Multi-Level Multi-Head Fusion Attention mechanism and recurrent neural network (RNN). The proposed structure has inputs of two modalities: audio and text. For audio features, we determine the mel-frequency cepstrum (MFCC) from raw signals using the OpenSMILE toolbox. Further, we use pre-trained model of bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) for embedding text information. These features are fed parallelly into the self-attention mechanism base RNNs to exploit the context for each timestamp, then we fuse all representatives using multi-head attention technique to predict emotional states. Our experimental results on the three databases: Interactive Emotional Motion Capture (IEMOCAP), Multimodal EmotionLines Dataset (MELD), and CMU Multimodal Opinion Sentiment and Emotion Intensity (CMU-MOSEI), reveal that the combination of the two modalities achieves better performance than using single models. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on all introduced datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.",0

We capture investors' sentiment from cryptocurrency-specific news headlines. We use a lexicon-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique to construct a unique sentiment indicator, and the sentiment scores are generated using two financial dictionaries: Henry(2008)(HE) and Loughran and Mcdonald(2011)(LM). The findings of the study show that news sentiment has a significant impact on cryptocurrency returns. When the investors' sentiment is optimistic or bullish, the cryptocurrency market experiences herding behaviour, leading to an increase in prices. The diverse and heterogeneous nature of the various cryptocurrencies causes each individual cryptocurrency to respond differently to sentiment. Further, we see that sentiment has a more pronounced impact on young, small, and volatile cryptocurrencies. Our study is among the few studies that use cryptocurrency-specific news headlines rather than news bodies to build a news sentiment indicator. JEL codes: E49, G14, G15",1

Sarcastic statements are very complex as most of the time they sound in positive context if interpreted literally but actually the speaker mean the opposite of what they speak. Sarcasm detection is a subtask of opinion mining. The main intention behind sarcasm detection is to identify the user opinions or emotions expressed by the user in the written text. It plays a critical role in sentiment analysis by correctly identifying sarcastic or non sarcastic sentences. The sarcastic sentence has mixed polarity of both positive and negative words. Understanding sarcasm is quite a difficult and a challenging task even for humans as well as for machines. Various approaches for sarcasm detection are purely based on machine learning classifiers where training the classifier is based on simple lexical or dictionary based features. The objective of the work is to develop an unsupervised probabilistic relational model to identify sarcasm prevalent topics based on the sentiment distribution of the words in the tweets. The model estimates sentiment based topic level distribution. The model evaluation shows the sentiment associated words that do appear in the short text given the sentiment related label. The model outperforms the other baseline state of art Model for sarcasm detection as shown in the experimental result and it is very much suited for the prediction of sarcasm of a short tweet.",0

It aims to discover the affective state and sentimental change in each person in a conversation based on their opinions. There exists a wealth of interaction information that affects speaker sentiment in conversations. However, existing sentiment analysis approaches are insufficient in dealing with this subtask due to two primary reasons: the lack of benchmark conversational sentiment datasets and the inability to model interactions between individuals. To address these issues, in this paper, we first present a new conversational dataset that we created and made publicly available, named ScenarioSA, to support the development of conversational sentiment analysis models. Then, we investigate how interaction dynamics are associated with conversations and study the multidimensional nature of interactions, which is understandability, credibility and influence. Finally, we propose an interactive long short-term memory (LSTM) network for conversational sentiment analysis to model interactions between speakers in a conversation by (1) adding a confidence gate before each LSTM hidden unit to estimate the credibility of the previous speakers and (2) combining the output gate with the learned influence scores to incorporate the influences of the previous speakers. Extensive experiments are conducted on ScenarioSA and IEMOCAP, and the results show that our model outperforms a wide range of strong baselines and achieves competitive results with the state-of-art approaches.

These targets may not be referred to in the post, and may not be the target of opinion in the post. In this paper, we propose a novel enhanced method for identifying the writer's stance of a given tweet. This comprises a three-phase process for stance detection: (a) tweets preprocessing; here we clean and normalize tweets (e.g., remove stop-words) to generate words and stems lists, (b) features generation; in this step, we create and fuse two dictionaries for generating features vector, and lastly (c) classification; all the instances of the features are classified based on the list of targets. Our innovative feature selection proposes fusion of two ranked lists (top -k) of term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) scores and the sentiment information. We evaluate our method using six different classifiers: K nearest neighbor (K-NN), discernibility-based K-NN, weighted K-NN, class-based K-NN, exemplar-based K-NN, and Support Vector Machines. Furthermore, we investigate the use of Principal Component Analysis and study its effect on performance. The model is evaluated on the benchmark dataset (SemEval-2016 task 6), and the results significance is determined using t-test.

In this research, an approach is proposed for opinion aspect extraction and recognition in selling systems. We have used the users' opinions from the Digikala website (www.Digikala.com), which is an Iranian e-commerce company. In this research, a language-independent framework is proposed that is adjustable to other languages. In this regard, after necessary text processing and preparation steps, the existence of an aspect in an opinion is determined using deep learning algorithms. The proposed model combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and long-short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning approaches. CNN is one of the best algorithms for extracting latent features from data. On the other hand, LSTM can detect latent temporal relationships among different words in a text due to its memory ability and attention model. The approach is evaluated on six classes of opinion aspects. Based on the experiments, the proposed model's accuracy, precision, and recall are 70%, 60%, and 85%, respectively.

Disclosive transparency's subjective nature has rendered deep study into these problems and their remedies difficult. To improve this state of affairs, We introduce neural language model-based probabilistic metrics to directly model disclosive transparency, and demonstrate that they correlate with user and expert opinions of system transparency, making them a valid objective proxy. Finally, we demonstrate the use of these metrics in a pilot study quantifying the relationships between transparency, confusion, and user perceptions in a corpus of real NLP system descriptions.",0

Yet, contemporary quantitative research has conventionally avoided the most direct and nuanced source of this information: political and social texts. In contrast, qualitative research has long relied on the patterns in texts to understand detailed trends in public opinion, social issues, the terms of international alliances, and the positions of politicians. Yet, qualitative human reading does not scale to the accelerating mass of digital information available currently. Researchers are in need of automated tools that can extract meaningful opinions and judgments from texts. Thus, there is an emerging opportunity to marry the model-based, inferential focus of quantitative methodology, as exemplified by ideal point models, with high resolution, qualitative interpretations of language and positions. We suggest that using alternatives to simple bag of words (BOW) representations and re-focusing on aspect-sentiment representations of text will aid researchers in systematically extracting people's judgments and what is being judged at scale. The experimental results below show that our approach which automates the extraction of aspect and sentiment MWE pairs, outperforms BOW in classification tasks, while providing more interpretable parameters. By connecting expressed sentiment and the aspects being judged, PULSAR (Parsing Unstructured Language into Sentiment-Aspect Representations) also has deep implications for understanding the underlying dimensionality of issue positions and ideal points estimated with text. Our approach to parsing text into aspects-sentiment expressions recovers both expressive phrases (akin to categorical votes), as well as the aspects that are being judged (akin to bills). Thus, PULSAR or future systems like it, open up new avenues for the systematic analysis of high-dimensional opinions and judgments at scale within existing ideal point models.",1

Most of the recent approaches involve using semi-structured sources such as Wikipedia or information crawled from the web using a combination of extraction methods and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. In most cases, these approaches tend to make a compromise between accuracy and completeness. In our ongoing work, we examine a technique for building a knowledge graph over the increasing volume of open data published on the web. The rationale for this is two-fold. First, we intend to provide a foundation for making existing open datasets searchable through keywords similar to how information is sought on the web. The second reason is to generate logically consistent facts from usually inaccurate and inconsistent open datasets. Our approach to knowledge graph development will compute the confidence score of every relationship elicited from underpinning open data in the knowledge graph. Our method will also provide a scheme for extending coverage of a knowledge graph by predicting new relationships that are not in the knowledge graph. In our opinion, our work has major implications for truly opening up access to the hitherto untapped value in open datasets not directly accessible on the World Wide Web today.",0

We employed the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique for topic modeling and labeled each tweet message with the topic words that best describe it. We also utilized sentiment labels for each tweet and analyzed the distribution of different topics across different sentiment labels. Our in-depth analysis of week-wise data discovered that the two most discussed topics were “precautionary measures"""" and “vaccine"""" where people have discussed about its effectiveness and vaccination drive in India. We found that people mostly had neutral sentiments for the former topic (for instance, in week 6, number of negative tweets: 215 vs number of positive tweets: 196) while for the latter, overall sentiment polarity was negative (for instance, in week 8, number of negative tweets: 621 vs number of positive tweets: 209). It reflects peoples’ mistrust in the COVID-19 vaccine. Such kind of study is extremely helpful for public health agencies to understand the major concerns of people and their varied reactions to different issues. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",1

The opinions of the Twitter Netizens are still random or unclassified. The technique for classifying sentiment analysis requires an algorithm. One of the classification algorithms is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The more training data provided to the machine, the accuracy of the classification function model formed by the machine is also higher. But in making representations into numerical vectors, the dimensions of data become large due to the many features. Feature optimization needs to be done to the training data by reducing the dimensions of the training data while maintaining high model accuracy. The optimization feature used is the TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) feature extraction. sentiment analysis using TF-IDF feature extraction and stochastic gradient descent algorithm can classify Indonesian text appropriately according to positive and negative sentiment. Classification Performance using TF-IDF feature extraction and stochastic gradient descent algorithm obtained an accuracy is 85.141%.",1

However, this debate occurs, in many cases, in a polarized and socially fragmented way. The importance of a specific type of polarization marked by the expression of emotions (affective polarization) has recently been pointed out. This work seeks to analyze affective polarization through the study of opinions shared by users of Twitter during competitive events such as a political election (United States electoral campaign, 2016). To operationalize the affective polarization we propose, first, to consider the relationship between the user opinions about each contender. This approach allows us to describe what is the opinion of the supporters of one contender about the rest of them. Secondly, we combine sentiment analysis techniques, new diagrams describing graphically the tension between the positive and negative opinions, and numerical measurements obtained employing techniques borrowed from physics such as the gravity centers to identify and measure affective dispositions of users participating in this discussion. In summary, a way of measuring an emergent and central type of polarization in competitive contexts is proposed here.",1

Word embeddings that can map the words to low-dimensional vector representations have been widely used in natural language processing tasks. But the word embeddings based on context such as Word2Vec and GloVe fail to capture the sentiment information. Most of existing sentiment analysis methods incorporate emotional polarity (positive and negative) to improve the sentiment embeddings for the emotion classification. This article takes advantage of an emotional psychology model to learn the emotional embeddings in Chinese first. In order to combine the semantic space and an emotional space, we present two different purifying models from local (LPM) and global (GPM) perspectives based on Plutchik's wheel of emotions to add the emotional information into word vectors. The two models aim to improve the word vectors so that not only the semantically similar words but also the sentimentally similar words can be closer than before. The Plutchik's wheel of emotions model can give eight-dimensional vector for one word in emotional space that can capture more sentiment information than the binary polarity labels. The obvious advantage of the local purifying model is that it can be fit for any pretrained word embeddings. For the global purifying model, we can get the final emotional embeddings at once. These models have been extended to handle English texts. The experimental results on Chinese and English datasets show that our purifying model can improve the conventional word embeddings and some proposed sentiment embeddings for sentiment classification and multi-emotion classification.",1

Asif; Mirza, Farhaan; Pears, Russel",2019,"JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE","Article","Personality distinctively characterises an individual and profoundly influences behaviours. Social media offer the virtual community an unprecedented opportunity to generate content and share aspects of their life which often reflect their personalities. The interest in using deep learning to infer traits from digital footprints has grown recently; however, very limited work has been presented which explores the sentiment information conveyed. The present study, therefore, used a computational approach to classify personality from social media by gauging public perceptions underlying factors encompassing traits. In the research reported in this paper, a Sentiment-based Personality Detection system was developed to infer trait from short texts based on the 'Big Five' personality dimensions. We exploited the spirit of Neural Network Language Model (NNLM) by using a unified model that combines a Recurrent Neural Network named Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We performed sentiment classification by grouping short messages harvested online into three categories, namely positive, negative, and nonpartisan. This is followed by employing Global Vectors (GloVe) to build vectorial word representations. As such, this step aims to add external knowledge to short texts. Finally, we trained each variant of the models to compute prediction scores across the five traits. Experimental study indicated the effectiveness of our system. As part of our investigation, a case study was carried out to investigate the existing correlation of personality traits and opinion polarities which employed the proposed system. The results support the prior findings of the tendency of persons with the same traits to express sentiments in similar ways.",1

Besides being a mode of communication, the data generated from these interactions can also be leveraged to assess the performance of an institution or organization. People may evaluate public companies based on the opinions of their users. However, user-supplied information is brief and written in natural language. In addition to being brief, the process of sending messages or engaging in other social media interactions contains a great deal of context information. This multiplicity of context can be utilized to conduct a more in-depth analysis of user opinion. This study presents a new approach to opinion mining for social media microblogging data by applying an affective model and contextual analyses. The affective model is applied for sentiment analysis to measure the degree of each adjective from user opinion by evaluating adjectives according to their varying levels of pleasure and arousal. The contextual analysis in this paper is modeled based on topic, user, adjective, and personal characteristics. The contextual analysis has four main features: (1) Temporal keyword sentiment context, (2) Temporal user sentiment context, (3) User impression context, and (4) Temporal user character context. Our affective model outperformed 75.6% the accuracy and 74.98% of F1-score, rather than SVM. In the experiment, the contextual analysis performed graph visualization of output results for each query feature for future development.

Fake news that we are interested in is one of many kinds of deception in social media, but it's more important one as it is created with dishonest intention to mislead people. We are concerned about this issue because we have noticed that this phenomenon has recently caused through the means of social communication to change the course of society and peoples and also their views, for example, during revolutions in some Arab countries have emerged some false news that led to the absence of truth and stirs up public opinion and also fake of news is one of the factors Trump successes in the presidential election. So we decided to face and reduce this phenomenon, which is still the main factor to choose most of our decisions. Techniques of fake news detection varied, ingenious, and often exciting. In this paper our objective is to build a classifier that can predict whether a piece of news is fake or not based only its content, thereby approaching the problem from a purely deep learning perspective by RNN technique models (vanilla, GRU) and LSTMs. We will show the difference and analysis of results by applying them to the dataset that we used called LAIR. We found that the results are close, but the GRU is the best of our results that reached (0.217) followed by LSTM (0.2166) and finally comes vanilla (0.215). Due to these results, we will seek to increase accuracy by applying a hybrid model between the GRU and CNN techniques on the same data set.",0

G.",2020,"SOFT COMPUTING","Article","Technological advances and the Internet have changed the way consumers approach the market for assets and services. Increasingly, consumers use the opinions of others to make their decisions. Web sites have assessment indexes (ORIs, ORS), where consumers value products/services using discrete-value scales, like stars or likes. But these ways of assessing are being questioned for several reasons such as the answers' reliability, and the opinions representativeness and aggregation. Lack of reliability is since opinions are requested directly, which makes possible the paradox of the strategic aspect of decisions. Representativeness and aggregation problems are owing to an important loss of decisions information when using a single value, instead of using the interval that includes all feelings/opinions, as well as preferences cardinality in the aggregation that somehow reinforce those assessments. The aim of this work is to propose an index for products/services evaluation over the Internet. This index, called Quorum Valuation Opinion Reputation Index, takes unsolicited information from consumers, and through a semantic analysis and a majority aggregation process, builds a valuation interval. In addition, an opinion interval reliability index is proposed. The index has been tested with real data in the tourism field.",0

Specifically, we divide the AOPE task into aspect term extraction (ATE) and aspect-specified opinion extraction (ASOE) subtasks; we first extract all the candidate aspect terms and then the corresponding opinion words given the aspect term. Unlike existing approaches that use the BIO-based tagging scheme for extraction, the QDSL model adopts a span-based tagging scheme and builds a question-answer-based machine-reading comprehension task for an effective aspect-opinion pair extraction.

Literature Based Discovery is a sub-field within biomedical text mining that peruses these articles to formulate high confident hypotheses on possible connections between medical concepts. Although many alternate methodologies have been proposed over the last decade, they still suffer from scalability issues. The primary reason, apart from the dense inter-connections between biological concepts, is the absence of information on the factors that lead to the edge-formation. In this work, we formulate this problem as a collaborative filtering task and leverage a relatively new concept of word-vectors to learn and mimic the implicit edge-formation process. Along with single-class classifier, we prune the search-space of redundant and irrelevant hypotheses to increase the efficiency of the system and at the same time maintaining and in some cases even boosting the overall accuracy. Results: We show that our proposed framework is able to prune up to 90% of the hypotheses while still retaining high recall in top-K results. This level of efficiency enables the discovery algorithm to look for higher-order hypotheses, something that was infeasible until now. Furthermore, the generic formulation allows our approach to be agile to perform both open and closed discovery. We also experimentally validate that the core data-structures upon which the system bases its decision has a high concordance with the opinion of the experts.This coupled with the ability to understand the edge formation process provides us with interpretable results without any manual intervention.",0

The increasing volume of information generated in microblogs has led to the need of automatically determining the sentiment expressed in microblog comments. Researchers have worked in systematically analyzing microblog comments in order to identify the sentiment expressed in them. Most work in sentiment analysis of microblog comments has been focused on comments written in the English language, whereas fewer efforts have been made in predicting the sentiment of Greek microblog comments. In this paper, we propose a lexicon-based sentiment analysis algorithm for the sentiment classification of both Greek and English microblog comments. The proposed method uses a unified approach for determining the sentiment of comments written in both languages and incorporates techniques that exploit the distinctive features of the language used in microblogs in order to accurately predict the sentiment expressed in microblog comments. Our approach achieves promising results for the sentiment classification of microblog comments into positive, negative or neutral.",1

Oftentimes, viewpoints expressed by different users exhibit a hierarchical structure. Therefore, detecting this kind of hierarchical viewpoints offers a better insight to understand the public opinion. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian model for hierarchical viewpoint discovery from tweets. Driven by the motivation that a viewpoint expressed in a tweet can be regarded as a path from the root to a leaf of a hierarchical viewpoint tree, the assignment of the relevant viewpoint topics is assumed to follow two nested Chinese restaurant processes. Moreover, opinions in text are often expressed in un-semantically decomposable multi-terms or phrases, such as 'economic recession'. Hence, a hierarchical Pitman-Yor process is employed as a prior for modelling the generation of phrases with arbitrary length. Experimental results on two Twitter corpora demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian model for hierarchical viewpoint discovery. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1

Identification of behaviors and emotions from user posts is examined under the heading of sentiment analysis (SA) studies using the natural language processing (NLP) techniques. In this study, a novel TCNN-Bi-LSTM model using the two-stage convolutional neural network (TCNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) architectures was proposed. While TCNN layers enable the extraction of strong local features, the output of these layers feeds the Bi-LSTM model that remembers forward-looking information and capture long-term dependencies. In this study, first, preprocessing steps were applied to the raw dataset. Thus, strong features were extracted from the obtained quality dataset using the FastText word embedding technique that pre-trained with location-based and sub-word information features. The experimental results of the proposed method are promising compared to the baseline deep learning and machine learning models. Also, experimental results show that while the FastText data embedding technique achieves the best performance compared to other word embedding techniques in all deep learning classification models, it has not had the same outstanding success in machine learning models. This study aims to investigate the sentiments of tweets about the COVID-19 vaccines and comments on these tweets among Twitter users by using the power of Twitter data. A new dataset collected from Twitter was constructed to be used in experimental results. This study will facilitate detecting inappropriate, incomplete, and erroneous information about vaccination. The results of this study will enable society to broaden its perspective on the administered vaccines. It can also assist the government and healthcare agencies in planning and implementing the vaccination's promotion on time to achieve the herd immunity provided by the vaccination.",1

We compare static word embeddings with the non-static embeddings that provide the possibility of incrementally up-training and updating word embedding in the training phase. Our proposed architectures are evaluated on two recent well-known datasets in the field, namely ISOT and LIAR. Our results on the best architecture show encouraging performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 7.9% on ISOT and 2.1% on the test set of the LIAR dataset.",0

It has been observed that a large number of reviews and comments regarding educational institutions are placed on these sites. As we all know, many new platforms have been formed over time, increasing the activity of users to voice their opinions on these platforms. As a result, users, particularly students, are more likely to become perplexed while trying to conclude. To address this issue, this paper looks at the analysis of a few platforms as a source of getting the reviews/comments of Universities, and with the help of sentiment analysis, we get an overview of a specific universities' position in the market, which includes certain parameters such as quality of faculty, mess, infrastructure and so on. For this purpose, first, the reviews from known platforms are collected and then they are classified into a few categories like good, average, below average, and bad. At last, the results are shown in terms of an understandable report to the user, helping him/her to get into their dream university.

In this paper, we propose a new model for extracting an interpretable sentence embedding by introducing an Adaptive self-attention. Instead of using a vector, we use a 2-D matrix to represent the embedding and each valid row of the matrix represents a part of sentence. In addition, a length hierarchy mechanism with a unique loss function is applied to adaptively adjust the number of the valid rows of the matrix, which can solve the problem of attention redundancy in short sentences and lack of attention in long sentences. We evaluate our model on text classification tasks: news categorization, review categorization and opinion classification. The results show that our model, compared with other sentence embedding methods, achieve significant improvement in terms of performance when there exists a large amount of data and the length of the data is evenly distributed.",1

The challenge is, however, to provide easy, quick and relevant access to the vast amount of information that is available. One step towards facilitating information access to online health data is opinion mining. Even though the classification of patient opinions into positive and negative has been previously tackled, most works make use of machine learning methods and bags of words. Our first contribution is an extensive evaluation of different features, including lexical, syntactic, semantic, network-based, sentiment-based and word embeddings features to represent patient-authored texts for polarity classification. The second contribution of this work is the study of polar facts (i.e. objective information with polar connotations). Traditionally, the presence of polar facts has been neglected and research in polarity classification has been bounded to opinionated texts. We demonstrate the existence and importance of polar facts for the polarity classification of health information. Material and methods We annotate a set of more than 3500 posts to online health forums of breast cancer, crohn and different allergies, respectively. Each sentence in a post is manually labeled as experience, fact or opinion, and as positive, negative and neutral. Using this data, we train different machine learning algorithms and compare traditional bags of words representations with word embeddings in combination with lexical, syntactic, semantic, network-based and emotional properties of texts to automatically classify patient-authored contents into positive, negative and neutral. Beside, we experiment with a combination of textual and semantic representations by generating concept embeddings using the UMLS Metathesaurus. Results We reach two main results: first, we find that it is possible to predict polarity of patient-authored contents with a very high accuracy (approximate to 70 percent) using word embeddings, and that this considerably outperforms more traditional representations like bags of words; and second, when dealing with medical information, negative and positive facts (i.e. objective information) are nearly as frequent as negative and positive opinions and experiences (i.e. subjective information), and their importance for polarity classification is crucial.",1

A.",2019,"2019 19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN ICT FOR EMERGING REGIONS (ICTER - 2019)","Proceedings Paper","People of the Internet era usually rely on online reviews to make decisions about an online purchase, a hotel booking or a car rental and much more, since people believe that making decisions based on other's opinions lead to making the right choice. As writing fake reviews come with monetary gain, the opinion spam activities have increased dramatically on online review websites. Thus opinion spam in reviews has become a big challenge to people to make purchase decisions as well as damages the reputation of review websites. Hence the deceptive opinion spam detection is an essential task in the field of natural language processing. Most of the existing research on opinion spam detection uses the traditional bag-of-words model to represent the review text features and apply standard machine learning models such as Support-Vector Machines or Wye Bayes as classifiers. There is only a few state of the art methods, which have utilized neural network based methods for spam detection. With the recent advancements in deep learning, there are successful applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for natural language processing problems which have achieved improved performance. In this study, a CNN model is developed to detect opinion spam using the features extracted from the pre-trained GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation model. Moreover, some word and character level features used in existing research work, are extracted from the text and concatenated with a feature set extracted by the convolutional layers of the model to improve the performance. The proposed model found to outperform the state-of-the-art method and the inclusion of additional features improved the performance further.",0

In this digital era, people are expressing emotions and opinions via social media towards various issues including the satisfactions of using certain products or services. Since telecommunications companies are competitive, they tend to focus more on which is the best service they can give to consumers, rather than concentrating on what consumers need. In addition, customers require other user reviews to help them choose the most suitable service based on their criteria. This work focuses on obtaining the positive and negative feedbacks by the customers using sentiment analysis method to visualize the data in an informative way. Lexicon-based approach is used during pre-processing phase as it is more suitable to manage abbreviations, symbols and language other than English. Then, Naive Bayes classifier is applied to classify the positive and negative words.

Drift detection algorithms emphasize detecting the drift. The drift detection algorithm needs to be very sensitive to change in data distribution for detecting the maximum number of drifts in the data stream. But highly sensitive drift detectors lead to higher false-positive drift detections. This paper proposed a Drift Detection-based Adaptive Ensemble classifier for sentiment analysis and opinion mining, which uses these false-positive drift detections to benefit and minimize the negative impact of false-positive drift detection signals. The proposed method creates and adds a new classifier to the ensemble whenever a drift happens. A weighting mechanism is implemented, which provides weights to each classifier in the ensemble. The weight of the classifier decides the contribution of each classifier in the final classification results. The experiments are performed using different classification algorithms, and results are evaluated on the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-measures.

Moments of great political and cultural transformation can motivate and activate these racial projects, generating racialized representations that attach racial meaning to bodies. Much of the research on Muslim representations in news media centers on this very question: did the attacks of 9/11 usher in a new racial project? Previous studies offer competing hypotheses. Bridging social movement and communication theories with a theory of ethnoracial formation, the author develops an approach for evaluating racial framing processes through a comparison of diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational frames. The author applies this approach using computational text analysis techniques to examine latent shifts in the racial framing of Muslims in the New York Times in the decade before and after 9/11. The author finds evidence of increasingly racialized, but more complex, representations of Muslims in the decade after 9/11 in which diagnostic frames evolve from locating social problems in states and institutions to locating social problems in Muslim bodies. Prognostic frames shift from institutional reforms to those targeting group pathology. The author argues that excavating the latent mechanisms of racial projects helps us better understand the dynamic and ongoing processes of ethnoracial formation.",0

It also investigates whether training separate male and female variants could improve the accuracy of machine learning for sentiment analysis. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses ratings-balanced sets of reviews of restaurants and hotels (3 sets) to train algorithms with and without gender selection. Findings - Accuracy is higher on female-authored reviews than on male-authored reviews for all data sets, so applications of sentiment analysis using mixed gender data sets will over represent the opinions of women. Training on same gender data improves performance less than having additional data from both genders. Practical implications - End users of sentiment analysis should be aware that its small gender biases can affect the conclusions drawn from it and apply correction factors when necessary. Users of systems that incorporate sentiment analysis should be aware that performance will vary by author gender. Developers do not need to create gender-specific algorithms unless they have more training data than their system can cope with.

This research is aimed at providing a well secured and user-friendly online polling platform that has been developed to provide a sophisticated and reliable result compared to the paper-based surveys and other existing methods. The implemented platform is enabled for the public or non-probability sample of participants to express the views and thoughts in the form of voting. Blockchain technology, which is decentralized, ultra-transparent, based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) that records the provenance of a digital asset through the use of cryptographic hashing, has been used to improve the overall resilience of polling system. The proposed scheme satisfies the fundamental polling method criteria and achieves end-to-end verifiability. The Implemented system is built up by implementing a secured platform to avoid unauthorized access to prevent altering data and to remove fake accounts/logins by verifying the accounts. Additional features such as poll recommendation according to the user preferences and analysis of opinion polls have been implemented. This platform would be advantageous to many facets of society in governance and decision-making.",0

Assessing public communication of European executives in times of EU politicisation","Rauh, Christian; Bes, Bart Joachim; Schoonvelde, Martijn",2020,"EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH","Article","How do mainstream political executives cue their politicised constituencies on European integration? Moving beyond static expectations that EU politicisation induces executives to either undermine, defuse or defend integration, this article theorises executives' incentives under different configurations of public and partisan Euroscepticism in their home countries. Expectations are tested on the sentiment and complexity that executives attach to European integration in almost 9,000 public speeches delivered throughout the Euro Crisis. It is found that national leaders faced with sceptical public opinion and low levels of partisan Euroscepticism rhetorically undermine integration, whereas European Commissioners faced with similar conditions are prone to defend it. These responses intensify disproportionally with growing public Euroscepticism, but are moderated by Eurosceptic party strength in surprising ways. When such challenger parties come closer to absorbing the Eurosceptic potential in public opinion, executive communication turns more positive again but also involves less clear rhetorical signals. These findings move beyond existing uniform expectations on mainstream responses to Eurosceptic challenges and highlight the relevance of different domestic configurations of EU politicisation.",1

However, literature doesn't provide an answer to the following question: what explains fluctuations in the use of negative messages within political organisations during a given political campaign? The present paper examines this question in the context of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. Data consists of all tweets distributed by the official Twitter account of both campaign organisations (@YesScotland and @UK_Together) between June 16, 2014 and September 17, 2014. Results are obtained by a non-parametric local regression and by time-series regression analyses. Our model demonstrates that having an advance in the polls had a statistically significant influence on the tweet sentiment of at least one organisation during the referendum campaign: Better Together's messages were more negative when it was ahead in the polls. Meanwhile, Yes Scotland's messages were more negative after each of the leaders' debates.",0

While much research exists for the study of L2 English, there is little research for the study of L2 German. This study explores the implementation of a corpus-based writing course in German studies at Rhodes University in South Africa with students at third-year level who were learning to write longer texts that present and defend an opinion. In order to evaluate the success of the writing course in teaching specific academic collocations, a diachronic collection of learner writing was undertaken. Written assignments were used to create a learner corpus, RUDaF (Rhodes University Deutsch als Fremdsprache). The creation of a learner corpus of German before and during the writing course served as a reflective tool to aid in the evaluation and improvement of corpus-based teaching materials. This is exemplified through the students' use of three specific opinion-related everyday-academic German collocations before and after the writing course. The learner corpus revealed a marked improvement in the use of taught collocations before and during the writing course. These methods provide insights for other language educators who wish to implement corpus-based methods for improving writing in a second or foreign language, and for all educators wanting to assess improvements in student writing.",0

The research on the Tibetan Web pages content analysis is meaningful for public opinion monitoring. Detecting sensitive words is beneficial to understand public opinion of the minority. In this paper, we present a novel sensitive information classification algorithm and topic tracking algorithm for Web pages contents. First, a text sensitive information classification method is proposed based on a vector space model and cosine theorem. The main idea is the different locations of sensitive words gives different importance degrees at term weight computing. Building sensitive word list is an artificial work. Compared with sensitive thesaurus, Web texts are classified. Sensitive word list is the foundation of classification. After the classification of each texts, a new topic tracking algorithm is introduced, which monitors sensitive words during a period of time. The first step is to compute weight of sensitive words in a fixed period of time and select the top 10 sensitive words. The second step is to select the top 3 sensitive words to track in 10 sensitive words. Experiments show that the classification of the text sensitive information is very effective and result of topic tracking is ideal.",0

In this study, we propose a modified Bayesian Boosting algorithm with weight-guided optimal feature selection for sentiment analysis. The goal is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of sentiment classification by selecting the most informative features and utilizing an optimized boosting algorithm. The proposed algorithm leverages the strength of the Bayesian framework and boosting techniques to handle the challenges of sentiment analysis effectively. It incorporates a feature selection mechanism that assigns weights to individual features based on their importance in sentiment classification. This weight-guided feature selection approach helps identify the most relevant and discriminative features, enhancing classification performance. The algorithm employs a modified Bayesian boosting algorithm to optimize the boosting process. It dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to weak classifiers during the boosting iterations, emphasizing the misclassified instances and providing more focused learning for accurate sentiment prediction. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a benchmark sentiment analysis dataset, comparing it with other state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate that the modified Bayesian Boosting algorithm with weight-guided optimal feature selection achieves superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The algorithm shows its effectiveness in capturing the sentiment patterns and improving the overall sentiment classification performance. The results demonstrated that the proposed model had gained an accuracy level of 98.49%, even the Random Forest algorithm gained an accuracy level of 78.6%, and the C4.5 model achieved an accuracy level of 68.58% individually. The proposed modified Bayesian Boosting algorithm with weight-guided optimal feature selection presents a promising approach for sentiment analysis. It effectively addresses the challenges of feature selection and boosting, leading to improved sentiment classification accuracy. The algorithm's ability to adjust weights and select informative features adaptively enhances its sentiment analysis tasks performance.

Big data are used for promoting products and provide better connectivity between retailers and shoppers. Nowadays, people always use online promotions to know about best shops for buying better products. This shopping experience and opinion about the shopper's shop can be observed by the customer-experience shared across social media platforms. A new customer when searching a shop needs information about manufacturing date (MRD) and manufacturing price (MRP), offers, quality, and suggestions which can only be provided by the previous customer experience. The MRP and MRD are already available in the product cover or label. Several approaches have been used for predicting the product details but not providing accurate information. This paper is motivated towards applying Machine Learning algorithms for learning, analysing and classifying the product information and the shop information based on the customer experience. The product data with customer reviews is collected from benchmark Unified computing system (UCS) which is a server for data based computer product lined up for evaluating hardware, support to visualization, software management.

Meanwhile, opinion spams spread widely and the detection of spam reviews becomes critically important for ensuring the integrity of the echo system of online reviews. Singleton spam reviews-one-time reviews-have spread widely of late as spammers can create multiple accounts to purposefully cheat the system. Most available techniques fail to detect this cunning form of malicious reviews, mainly due to the scarcity of behaviour trails left behind by singleton spammers. Available approaches also require extensive feature engineering, expensive manual annotation and are less generalizable. Based on our thorough study of spam reviews, it was found that genuine opinions are usually directed uniformly towards important aspects of entities. In contrast, spammers attempt to counter the consensus towards these aspects while covering their malicious intent by adding more text but on less important aspects. Additionally, spammers usually target specific time periods along products' lifespan to cause maximum bias to the public opinion. Based on these observations, we present an unsupervised singleton spam review detection model that runs in two steps. Unsupervised deep aspect-level sentiment model employing deep Boltzmann machines first learns fine-grained opinion representations from review texts. Then, an LSTM network is trained on opinion learned representation to track the evolution of opinions through the fluctuation of sentiments in a temporal context, followed by the application of a Robust Variational Autoencoder to identify spam instances. Experiments on three benchmark datasets widely used in the literature showed that our approach outperforms strong state-of-the-art baselines.",1

Recently, they have been connected with far-right political movements. This mixed-methods study investigates politics on Overboard, a Finnish imageboard. We use a convolutional neural network to learn linguistic features of the community's own understanding of politics, studying two large text corpora, collected in 2014-2015 and 2018-2019. This enables us to find political messages in nominally non-political subforums and discount non-political noise-finding the needles in the haystack. We quantify the prevalence of political talk on Overboard, assess its themes using topic modeling, and evaluate changes in their popularity. Finally, we qualitatively analyze the style of Overboard. We find that around one-tenth of messages on Overboard are identifiable as political. Often, but not univocally, they voice far-right opinions, usually somewhat ironically. The prevalence of far-right themes has increased, likely because of importing global imageboard culture and in parallel with the increased popularity of nationalist-right politics in the broader Finnish public sphere. In terms of group style, the strong boundary between members and outsiders, together with the ironic and cynical speech norms, creates a bond between members. Such a group style lends itself to politicizing the collective.",0

In this study, we focused on reviews based on highly emotion-embedded products/services, such as movies, music, and drama. Furthermore, we tried to solve the multiple polarities problem for the same review word for multiple types of product/service. First, we collected text written in Chinese from a Taiwanese movie forum. In our proposed approach, we applied an evolutionary strategy algorithm to optimize the weight tables corresponding to two different types of movies: horror and drama movies. The experimental results indicated that the proposed method performed better than conventional methods when considering only one generalized type. Further, we employed a new multi-class support vector machine approach for predicting opinions at the document level. We used seven measures to describe the characteristics of an overall document, including the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the predicted sentence value distribution, where the fluctuations in these values corresponded to their positions in the document. We also demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach for identifying opinions at the document level. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1

Based on data mining from multiple sources, including policy text from the strictest water resource management policy from 2011 to 2021, the reports of major media websites, and the Baidu Index, this study used the ROST-CM6 text-analysis tool to analyze the policy content, public opinion, and public perception of the strictest water resources management policy quantitatively and visually. The results found that the policy text and public-opinion are given high attention to the water resources assessment, water control management, and water resources protection, but the policy text focuses on the macro level, and pays more attention to national development and long-term planning. The public opinion belongs to the micro level and is more economic, and there is a certain degree of media bias. With notable regional disparities, the general public's opinion of the harshest water resource management policy has been rising every year. This research adds to the global body of knowledge on water governance, and serves as a guide for Chinese and other governments looking to improve their water resource management strategies.",1

Defining optimal (or personalized) learning paths is thus impeded. This paper now takes a closer look at 7 curricula from 6 different countries and presents an approach for the identification of learning outcomes and dependencies (requires and expands) between them in order to support the identification of learning paths. The approach includes different strategies from natural language processing, but it also makes use of a refined and simplified version of Bloom's Taxonomy to identify dependencies between the learning outcomes. It is shown that the identification of similar learning outcomes works very well compared to expert opinions. The identification of dependencies, however, only works well for detecting learning outcomes that refine other learning outcomes (expands dependency). The detection of learning outcomes which build on each other (requires dependency) is, on the other hand, still heavily dependent on the definition of dictionaries and a computing science topics ontology.",0

As of February 2020, more than 500 h of video were uploaded to YouTube every minute. This equates to approximately 30,000 h of newly uploaded content per hour. The amount of content on YouTube has increased dramatically as consumers’ appetites for online video have grown. Indeed, the number of video hours uploaded every 60 s increased by roughly 40% between 2014 and 2020. The direct means of user review for this content is the comment section. To survive this cut-through competition, the content creators should constantly check up on their viewers’ opinions, their reviews, and their sentiments toward the video. Although comments provide a direct means of feedback, the YouTuber cannot actually read all those comments. There may be times when he wants to know the drawbacks of the video. This paper proposes a dashboard that assists the content creators in actually looking at the positivity and negativity they have gained through the video.

Many studies have developed a wide variety of algorithms capable of classifying texts according to the sentiment conveyed in them. Such sentiment is usually expressed as positive, neutral or negative. However, neutral reviews are often ignored in many sentiment analysis problems because of their ambiguity and lack of information. In this paper, we propose to empower neutrality by characterizing the boundary between positive and negative reviews, with the goal of improving the model's performance. We apply different sentiment analysis methods to different corpora extracting their sentiment and, hence, detecting neutral reviews by consensus to filter them, i.e., taking into account different models based on weighted aggregation. We finally compare classification performance on single and aggregated models. The results clearly show that aggregation methods outperform single models in most cases, which led us to conclude that neutrality is key for distinguishing between positive and negative and, then, for improving sentiment classification.",1

Nowadays, these websites are considered the most appropriate place to express feelings and opinions. The popular social media site Twitter offers valuable insight into people's thoughts. Throughout the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, people from all over the world have expressed their opinions. In this study, machine-learning  and deep-learning  techniques are used to understand people's emotions and their views about this war are revealed. This study unveils a novel deep learning approach that merges the best features of the sequence and transformer models while fixing their respective flaws. The model combines Roberta with ABSA (Aspect based sentiment analysis) and Long Short-Term Memory for sentiment analysis. A large dataset of geographically tagged tweets related to the Ukraine-Russia war was collected from Twitter. We analyzed this dataset using the Roberta-based sentiment model. In contrast, the Long Short-Term Memory model can effectively capture long-distance contextual semantics. The Robustly optimized BERT with ABSA approach maps words into a compact, meaningful word embedding space. The accuracy of the suggested hybrid model is 94.7%, which is higher than the accuracy of the state-of-the-art techniques.",1

Our objective was to evaluate the reliability of smartphone-based instant messaging applications for the evaluation of various pediatric limb traumas, as compared with the standard method of viewing images of a workstation-based picture archiving and communication system (PACS). Methods X-ray images of 73 representative cases of pediatric limb trauma were captured and transmitted to 5 pediatric orthopedic surgeons by the Whatsapp instant messaging application on an iPhone 6 smartphone. Evaluators were asked to diagnose, classify, and determine the course of treatment for each case over their personal smartphones. Following a 4-week interval, revaluation was conducted using the PACS. Intraobserver agreement was calculated for overall agreement and per fracture site. Results The overall results indicate near perfect agreement between interpretations of the radiographs on smartphones compared with computer-based PACS, with kappa of 0.84, 0.82, and 0.89 for diagnosis, classification, and treatment planning, respectively. Looking at the results per fracture site, we also found substantial to near perfect agreement. Conclusions Smartphone-based instant messaging applications are reliable for evaluation of a wide range of pediatric limb fractures. This method of obtaining an expert opinion from the off-site specialist is immediately accessible and inexpensive, making smartphones a powerful tool for doctors in the emergency department, primary care clinics, or remote medical centers, enabling timely and appropriate treatment for the injured child.

"11807","Outlier Detection on Semantic Space for Sentiment Analysis With Convolutional Neural Networks","Lemos Schmitt, Murilo Falleiros; Spinosa, Eduardo J.",2018,"2018 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)","Proceedings Paper","Sentiment analysis is a text categorization problem that consists in automatically assigning text documents to pre-defined classes that represent sentiments or a positive/negative opinion about a subject. To solve this task, machine learning techniques can be used. However, in order to achieve good generalization, these techniques require a thorough pre-processing and an apropriate data representation. To deal with these fundamental issues, this work proposes the use of convolutional neural networks and density-based clustering algorithms. The word representations used in this work were obtained from vectors previously trained in an unsupervised way, denominated word embeddings. These representations are able to capture syntactic and semantic information of words, which leads to similar words to be projected closer together in the semantic space. In this scenario, in order to improve the performance of the convolutional neural network, the use of a clustering algorithm in the semantic space to extract additional information from the data is proposed. A density-based clustering algorithm was used to detect and remove outliers from the documents to be classified before these documents were used to train the convolutional neural network. We conducted experiments with two different embeddings across three datasets in order to validate the effectiveness of our method. Results show that removing outliers from documents is capable of slightly improving the accuracy of the model and reducing computational cost for the non-static training approach.",1

Much prior research focuses on the automated detection of these fake reviews, which are far from perfect. Therefore, consumers must be able to detect fake reviews on their own. In this study we survey the research examining how consumers detect fake reviews online. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review over the research on fake review detection from the consumer-perspective. We included academic literature giving new empirical data. We provide a narrative synthesis comparing the theories, methods and outcomes used across studies to identify how consumers detect fake reviews online. Results: We found only 15 articles that met our inclusion criteria. We classify the most often used cues identified into five categories which were (1) review characteristics (2) textual characteristics (3) reviewer characteristics (4) seller characteristics and (5) characteristics of the platform where the review is displayed. Discussion: We find that theory is applied inconsistently across studies and that cues to deception are often identified in isolation without any unifying theoretical framework. Consequently, we discuss how such a theoretical framework could be developed. © 2023 The Authors",0

Objective information such as news, and subjective content such as opinions and emotions are intertwined and readily available. This data is very appealing from both a research and a commercial point of view, for applications such as public polling or marketing purposes. A complete understanding requires a combined view of information from different sources which are usually enriched (e.g. sentiment analysis) and visualized in a dashboard. In this work, we present a toolkit that tackles these issues on different levels: (1) to extract heterogeneous information, it provides independent data extractors and web scrapers; (2) data processing is done with independent semantic analysis services that are easily deployed; (3) a configurable Big Data orchestrator controls the execution of extraction and processing tasks; (4) the end result is presented in a sensible and interactive format with a modular visualization framework based on Web Components that connects to different sources such as SPARQL and ElasticSearch endpoints.

A little-understood aspect of this phenomenon and of the processing of online news in general is how sources influence whether people believe and share what they read. In contrast to the predigital era, the Internet makes it easy for anyone to imitate well-known and credible sources in name and appearance. In a preregistered survey experiment, we first investigate the effect of this contrast (real vs. fake source) and find that subjects, as expected, have a higher tendency to believe and a somewhat higher propensity to share news by real sources. We then expose subjects to a number of reports manipulated in content (congruent vs. incongruent with individuals' attitudes), which reveals our most crucial finding. As predicted, people are more likely to believe a news report by a source that has previously given them congruent information. However, this only holds if the source is fake. We further use machine learning to uncover treatment heterogeneity. Effects vary most strongly for different levels of trust in the mainstream media and having voted for the populist right.",0

Although existing neural network models show promising performances on ABSA, their capabilities can be unsatisfactory in cases where the amount of training data is limited. In this paper, we propose a unified model which exploits and incorporates multiple sources of knowledge to improve its ability on ABSA. Structure knowledge is extracted via clause recognition and fused in the model through the generation of multiple context representations to force the model to capture aspect-specific context information. Sentiment knowledge is exploited by means of training a general classification model with the sentiment labels of documents and fused through pretraining specific layers to extract contextual features and predict sentiment polarities more accurately. In addition, information of conjunctions is fused in our model to capture the relations between clauses and provide additional sentiment features. Experimental results on five publicly available ABSA datasets validate the effectiveness of our method and prove that multiple sources of knowledge can collaboratively enhance our model.

In particular, Twitter has a large number of geotagged tweets that make the analysis of sentiments across time and space possible. This study performs volume analysis and sentiment analysis using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and text mining over two datasets collected for different periods. To increase the adequacy and efficacy of the sentiment analysis, a hybrid feature engineering approach is proposed that elevates the performance of machine learning models. Geotagged tweets are used for volume analysis indicating that the highest number of tweets is originated from India, the US, the UK, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Analysis of positive and negative tweets reveals that negative tweets are mostly originated from India and the US. On the contrary, positive tweets belong to Pakistan and Afghanistan. LDA is used for topic modeling on two datasets containing tweets about the current situation after the Taliban take control of Afghanistan. Topics extracted through LDA suggest that majority of the Afghanistan people seem satisfied with the Taliban's takeover while the topics from negative tweets reveal that issues discussed in negative tweets are related to the US concerns in Afghanistan. Sentiment analysis over two different datasets indicates that the trend of the sentiments has been shifted positively over three weeks.",1

Firstly, since the methods used for performing authorship analysis imply that an author can be recognized by the content he or she creates, we were interested in finding out whether it would be possible for an author identification system to correctly attribute works to authors if in the course of years they have undergone a major psychological transition. Secondly - and from the point of view of the evolution of an author's ethical values - we checked what it would mean if the authorship attribution system encounters difficulties in detecting single authorship. We set out to answer those questions through performing a binary authorship analysis task using a text classifier based on a pre-trained transformer model and a baseline method relying on conventional similarity metrics. For the test set, we chose several works of Arata Osada, a Japanese educator and specialist in the history of education, with half of them being books written before the Second World War and another half in the 1950s, in between which the author underwent a transformation in terms of political opinions. As a result, we were able to confirm that in the case of texts authored by Arata Osada in a time span of more than 10 years, while the classification accuracy drops by a large margin and is substantially lower than for texts by other non-fiction writers, confidence scores of the predictions remain at a similar level as in the case of a shorter time span, indicating that the classifier was in many instances tricked into deciding that texts written by Arata Osada over a time span of multiple years were actually written by two different people, which in turn leads us to believe that such a change can affect authorship analysis, and that historical events have great impact on a person's ethical outlook as expressed in their writings.",0

In this work, we perform a sentiment analysis with the help of Apache Spark framework, which is considered an open source distributed data processing platform which utilizes distributed memory abstraction. The goal of using Apache Spark's Machine learning library (MLIB) is to handle an extraordinary amount of data effectively. We recommend some Preprocessing and Machine learning text feature extraction steps for getting greater results in Sentiment Analysis classification. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is proved against other approaches achieving better classification results when using Na ve Bayes, Logistic Regression and Decision trees classification algorithms. Finally, our solution estimates the performance of Apache Spark concerning its scalability.",1

These opinions can be expressed in text, speech or images. Analysis of these sentiments is one of the popular research areas of present day researchers. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining tries to identify or classify these sentiments or opinions into two broad categories - positive and negative. Much work on sentiment analysis has been done on social media conversations, blog posts, newspaper articles and various narrative texts. However, when it came to identifying emotions from scientific papers, researchers used to face difficulties due to the implicit and hidden natures of opinions or emotions. As the citation instances are considered inherently positive in emotion, popular ranking and indexing paradigms often neglect the opinion present while citing. Therefore in the present paper, we deployed a system of citation sentiment analysis to achieve three major objectives. First, we identified sentiments in the citation text and assigned a score to each of the instances. We have used a supervised classifier for this purpose. Secondly, we have proposed a new index (we shall refer to it hereafter as M-index) which takes into account both the quantitative and qualitative factors while scoring a paper. Finally, we developed a ranking of research papers based on the M-index. We have also shown the impacts of M-index on the ranking of scientific papers.",1

Given the growing popularity of social media applications, social sensing networks with users acting as smart social sensors provide a unique channel for understanding social events. Current research on social events through geo-tagged social media is mainly focused on the extraction of information about when, where, and what happened, i.e., event detection. There is a trend towards the machine learning of more complex events from even larger input data. This research work will undoubtedly lead to a better understanding of big geo-data. In this study, however, we start from known or detected events, raising further questions on how they happened, how they affect people's lives, and for how long. By combining machine learning, natural language processing, and visualization methods in a generic analytical framework, we attempt to interpret the impact of known social events from the dimensions of time, space, and semantics based on geo-tagged social media data. The whole analysis process consists of four parts: (1) preprocessing; (2) extraction of event-related information; (3) analysis of event impact; and (4) visualization. We conducted a case study on the 2014 Shanghai Stampede event on the basis of Chinese Sina Weibo data. The results are visualized in various ways, thus ensuring the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed framework. Both the methods and the case study can serve as decision references for situational awareness and city management.",0

Okudan; Park, W-Y",2019,"ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS","Article","Previous studies mainly employed customer surveys to collect survey data for understanding customer preferences on products and developing customer preference models. In reality, customer preferences on products could change over time. Thus, the time series data of customer preferences under different time periods should be collected for the modelling of customer preferences. However, it is difficult to obtain the time series data based on customer surveys because of long survey time and substantial resources involved. In recent years, a large number of online customer reviews of products can be found on various websites, from which the time series data of customer preferences can be extracted easily. Some previous studies have attempted to analyse customer preferences on products based on online customer reviews. However, two issues were not addressed in previous studies which are the fuzziness of the sentiment expressed by customers existing in online reviews and the modelling of customer preferences based on the time series data obtained from online reviews. In this paper, a new methodology for dynamic modelling of customer preferences based on online customer reviews is proposed to address the two issues which mainly involves opinion mining and dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system (DENFIS). Opinion mining is adopted to analyze online reviews and perform sentiment analysis on the reviews under different time periods. With the mined time series data and the product attribute settings of reviewed products, a DENFIS approach is introduced to perform the dynamic modelling of customer preferences. A case study is used to illustrate the proposed methodology. The results of validation tests indicate that the proposed DENFIS approach outperforms various adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) approaches in the dynamic modelling of customer preferences in terms of the mean relative error and variance of errors. In addition, the proposed DENFIS approach can provide both crisp and fuzzy outputs that cannot be realized by using existing ANFIS and conventional DENFIS approaches.",1

Reviews that are posted online are one of the methods of communication between the company and the consumers. Therefore, companies can analyse the reviews posted online to identify the aspects and sentiments that are mentioned in the reviews. However, the process of analysing the reviews manually is inefficient and is prone to bias. One of the methods of tackling manually analysing is by using machine learning. This process is called aspect-based sentiment analysis, there are many aspect-based sentiment analysis studies and research has been done previously. However, majority of the previous studies focuses on other domains such as product reviews or restaurant reviews. Therefore, this research will focus on the movie industry where movie reviews will be used to train and predict the aspects and sentiment of the movie review using machine learning models. This research will perform both aspect prediction and sentiment prediction on different models. The aspect prediction will be done using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree whist the Sentiment Analysis will be done using Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naïve Bayes. Based on the findings of the study, Decision Tree was able to achieve a higher accuracy of 98% while Logistic Regression was able to score an accuracy of 92%. Additionally, Logistic Regression was able to score a better accuracy for Sentiment Prediction with an accuracy of 93% when compared to Multinomial Naïve Bayes which achieved an accuracy of 91 %. Therefore, Decision Tree is more suitable for Aspect Prediction whilst Logistic Regression is more suitable for Sentiment Analysis. © 2023 IEEE.",1

One green strategy in mobile device manufacturing is to refurbish and reuse these products. Consumer feedback in the secondary market impress decision-makers and manufacturer strategies. This research provides a framework that focuses on data mining techniques to investigate consumer attitudes toward refurbished phones by one of the reverse supply chain practices: refurbishment. Furthermore, the consumer's opinions on refurbished mobile phones found on Twitter have been analyzed, and the most appropriate selling strategy has been proposed. Accordingly, the customer's strong motivating factors were identified by assessing approximately 25,000 tweets. The obtained data are analyzed according to three categories: environmental versus financial motivators, refurbished mobile phone features, and main components of refurbished mobile phones. The results indicate that the environmental factor is slightly higher motivating when compared to the financial factor. Other important features were prioritized from the consumer's point of view (highest to lowest): price, product warranty, quality, and seller's reputation. In a separate analysis, camera, display, battery, performance, innovative technologies, and internal memory were found to be the top components of a mobile device that customers pay attention to the most. Interrelationships between identified features were established using interpretive structural modeling (ISM) to accomplish a comprehensive framework. Classification analysis was performed by the matrix of cross-impact multiplications applied to classifications (MICMAC) technique to identify these features based on their driving and dependence power.

Opinions reflected in microblogs have provided businesses with great opportunities to acquire insights into their operating environments in real time. In particular, the relationship between microblog sentiment and stock returns is of great interest to investment professionals and academic researchers across multiple disciplines. We empirically test this complex relationship in a comprehensive study. We perform vector autoregression on a data set containing close to 18 million microblog messages spanning 4 years at the market and the individual stock levels, and at the daily and the hourly frequencies. The results show that the influence of microblog sentiment on stock returns is both statistically and economically significant at the hour level. Microblog sentiment is also largely driven by movements in the market. Moreover, stock returns have a stronger influence on negative sentiment than on positive sentiment. These findings have important implications for both research and practice.",1

Timeliness of data is important in making major decision. However, the manual data labeling method is slow and expensive, it also cannot cope with this enormous amount of data. We investigated the literature of sentiment analysis and discovered most of the works using manual data labeling. We propose semi-supervised learning as a method that helps to reducing the effort and time needed in data labeling as it uses a combination of small amount of labeled data and a large pool of unlabeled data for model training. In our work, we trained semi supervised deep neural network with different settings and compared the model performances to a baseline, the supervised deep neural network trained with same number of labeled data. From the results, we can see that the unlabeled data is useful in improving the data performances. But it is not a guarantee, the unlabeled data must be handled with care otherwise degraded the model performances. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",1

While these tools demonstrate the potential to support students' learning and instructors' teaching, they also raise concerns about enabling unethical uses by students. Previous research has suggested various strategies aimed at addressing these issues. However, they concentrate on introductory programming courses and focus on one specific type of problem. The present research evaluated the performance of ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art AI assistant, at solving 187 problems spanning three distinct types that were collected from six undergraduate computer science. The selected courses covered different topics and targeted different program levels. We then explored methods to modify these problems to adapt them to ChatGPT's capabilities to reduce potential misuse by students. Finally, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 computer science instructors. The aim was to gather their opinions on our problem modification methods, understand their perspectives on the impact of AI assistants on computer science education, and learn their strategies for adapting their courses to leverage these AI capabilities for educational improvement. The results revealed issues ranging from academic fairness to long-term impact on students' mental models.

Due to the richness of language expressions, customer opinions are often expressed implicitly. However, previous studies usually focus on mining explicit opinions to understand consumer needs. In this paper, we propose a novel implicit opinion analysis model to perform implicit opinion analysis of Chinese customer reviews at both the feature and review levels. First, we extract an implicit-opinionated review/clause dataset from raw review dataset and introduce the concept of the feature-based implicit opinion pattern (FBIOP). Secondly, we develop a clustering algorithm to construct product feature categories. Based on the constructed feature categories, FBIOPs can be mined from the extracted implicit-opinionated clause dataset. Thirdly, the sentiment intensity and polarity of each FBIOP are calculated by using the Chi squared test and pointwise mutual information. Fourthly, according to the resulting FBIOP polarities, the polarities of implicit opinions can be determined at both the feature and review levels. Car forum reviews written in Chinese are collected and labeled as the experimental dataset. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the traditional support vector machine model and the cutting-edge convolutional neural network model.",1

The primary source of data for this research has been published judicial opinions that describe cases and their outcomes. However, only a relatively small number of cases result in published opinions, and this sample of cases may be subject to serious biases. Based on computational text analysis of over 150,000 published opinions issued by federal appellate courts in the years 1970-2010, we find strong evidence of data bias based on relationships between the party affiliations of judges on appellate court panels and the characteristics of cases that result in published opinions. These relationships imply that the inferential model that underlies much of the judicial politics literature can lead to biased or spurious findings concerning the causal influence of judicial attributes on case outcomes.",0

Mining for these latent emotions can offer clues about users' affective state on a broad range of topics ranging from their mental health to political opinions. This paper proposes a supervised machine learning approach to detect emotions from tweets. The approach is built around a Crowdflower data set of 40; 000 tweets labeled with 13 distinct emotions. These 13 labels were mapped to emotions guided by the Plutchik's wheel, and are further organized into pairs of polar opposites leading to four binary classification problems: Love vs. Hate, Joy vs. Sadness, Trust vs. Disgust, and Anticipation vs. Surprise. For each classification problem, five supervised machine learning models were trained on a combination of linguistic and metadata features extracted from the tweets. The performance of these models is evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and AUC. These results suggest that Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers show close to highest accuracy in distinguishing between pair-wise emotions. Although the emotions in each pair are polar opposites on the Plutchik's wheel, their classification performance differs widely; distinguishing between Love vs. Hate and Anticipation vs Surprise show the highest (87%) and lowest (77%) accuracy respectively. Feature importance splits the discriminating power 60% over linguistic and metadata features. Our results thus suggest that every pair of polar opposite emotions are not equally differentiable, and using both linguistic and metadata features leads to better accuracy over exclusively using text-based or sentiment features.",0

Firstly, data were retrieved from Twitter on 20 different queries related to productivity using RapidMiner platformand then sentiment analysis was performed employing AYLIEN Text Analysis Software. A total of 6416 tweets were mined from Twitter for a period of 13days. Further, 676 prominent hashtags had been identified where 83 hashtags were found to be associated with a geographical location in the tweets. It was observed that the United Kingdom was the most popular country which was being used as a hashtag on Twitter in relation to various facets of the productivity followed by India, the United States, China, and Nigeria. In regard to polarity, most of the tweets were found to be of neutral polarity and most of the positive tweets had a low percentage value. The information analyzed using this strategy can be repackaged as a consolidated time-based service and can be presented to libraries' users in different formats. This study not only introduces a nascent way to cater to the information needs of today's users, but also proposes a new way of conducting marketing in libraries using social media mining and sentiment analysis.",0

Nowadays, many researchers have developed methods that yield the best accuracy in performing analysis sentiment. Three particular models are Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which have deep learning architectures. CNN is used because of its ability to extract essential features from each sentence fragment, while LSTM and GRU are used because of their ability to memorize prior inputs. GRU has a more straightforward and more practical structure compared to LSTM. These models have been combined into hybrid architectures of LSTM-CNN, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-GRU. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the hybrid architectures for Indonesian sentiment analysis in e-commerce reviews. Besides all three combined models mentioned above, we consider one more combined model, which is GRU-CNN. We evaluate the performance of each model, then compare the accuracy of the standard models with the combined models to see if the combined models can improve the performance of the standard. Our simulations show that almost all of the hybrid architectures give better accuracies than the standard models. Moreover, the hybrid architecture of LSTM-CNN reaches slightly better accuracies than other hybrid architectures.",1

The purpose of this system is to identify topic-based opinion leaders of social media. In order to accomplish this goal, several steps have been taken, such as data collection, data processing, data analysis, data classification, ranking of topic-based opinion leaders, and evaluation. The SNOL system has two main parts. In the first part, collected tweets are classified by semantic kernels for topic-based analysis. In the second part, leadership scores are given to each user in the network according to topic modeling and user modeling results. Leadership scores are then calculated with the formula generated and opinion leaders are determined for each category. Experiments are performed on data gathered from Twitter including 17,234,924 tweets from 38,727 users. The evaluation of opinion leader detection is a difficult job since there is no standard method for identifying opinion leaders. Therefore, the evaluation of the results of this study has been done using two different methods, retweet count and spread score, to prove that the suggested methodology outperforms the PageRank algorithm. The results have also been evaluated considering the user-topic sentiment correlation of the retrieved lists. Furthermore, SNOL has been compared against some opinion leader detection methods previously presented in the literature. The experimental results show that SNOL generates remarkably higher performance than the PageRank algorithm and other existing algorithms in the literature for nearly all topics and all selected top N opinion leaders.",0

In these courses, the intervention of tutors and teachers is essential to support students in the teaching-learning process, answer questions about their content, and provide engagement for students. However, as these courses have a vast and diverse audience, tutors and teachers find it difficult to monitor them closely and efficiently with prompt interventions. This work proposes an architecture to favor the construction of knowledge for students, tutors, and teachers through autonomous interference and recommendations of educational resources. The architecture is based on a conversational agent and an educational recommendation system. For the training of predictive models and extraction of semantic information, ontology and logical rules were used, together with inference algorithms and machine learning techniques, which act on a dataset with messages exchanged between course forum participants in the humanities, medicine, and education fields. The messages are classified according to the type (question, answer, and opinion) and parameters about feeling, confusion, and urgency. The architecture can infer the moment in which a student needs help and, through a Conversational Recommendation System, provides the student with the opportunity to revise his or her knowledge on the subject. To help in this task, the architecture can provide educational resources via an autonomous agent, contributing to reducing the degree of confusion and urgency identified in the posts. Initial results indicate that integrating technologies and resources, complementing each other, can support the students and help them succeed in their educational training.",0

This dataset is created by collecting 100 annotations per example for 3,113 examples in SNLI and MNLI and 1,532 examples in alpha ALI. Analysis reveals that: (1) high human disagreement exists in a noticeable amount of examples in these datasets; (2) the state-of-the-art models lack the ability to recover the distribution over human labels; (3) models achieve near-perfect accuracy on the subset of data with a high level of human agreement, whereas they can barely beat a random guess on the data with low levels of human agreement, which compose most of the common errors made by state-of-the-art models on the evaluation sets. This questions the validity of improving model performance on old metrics for the low-agreement part of evaluation datasets. Hence, we argue for a detailed examination of human agreement in future data collection efforts, and evaluating model outputs against the distribution over collective human opinions.(1)",1

Comparisons were made between the location and mechanism of injury, initial and final ocular signs, interventions and additional extraocular injuries. Results Two cases were of police officers and the remaining were Turkish military soldiers. All of our cases were injured in urban district by terrorist snipers hidden in apartments. Four individuals were injured in the right eye and the other was injured bilaterally. Initial visual acuities (VA) ranged from no light perception (NLP) to 0.0 with logMAR. Final VA raised to 0.0 in three patients whereas in two of NLP patients it remained the same. Mean Ocular Trauma Score was 2.2. Two eyes necessitated evisceration and the others underwent vitrectomy surgery. Conclusions The prognosis of SSOI is unpredictable and is highly dependent on the trajectory and energy deposition. Primary evisceration or enucleation should be reserved to severely ruptured globe cases with no chance of globe-saving procedures. If the globe remains intact, retinal and vitreal damage should be repaired. Due to risk of associated intracranial injury, all patients should be referred for neurosurgical opinion.",0
"11562","Drug Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning Classifiers","Uddin, Mohammed Nazim; Bin Hafiz, Md Ferdous; Hossain, Sohrab; Islam, Shah Mohammad Mominul",2022,"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS","Article","In recent times, one of the most emerging sub -dimensions of natural language processing is sentiment analysis which refers to analyzing opinion on a particular subject from plain text. Drug sentiment analysis has become very significant in present times as classifying medicines based on their effectiveness through analyzing reviews from users can assist potential future consumers in gaining knowledge and making better decisions about a particular drug. The objective of this proposed research is to measure the effectiveness level of a particular drug. Currently most of the text mining researches are based on unsupervised machine learning methods to cluster data. When supervised learning methods are used for text mining, the usual primary concern is to classify the data into two classes. Lack of technical terms in similar datasets make the categorization even more challenging. The proposed research focuses on finding out the keywords through tokenization and lemmatization so that better accuracy can be achieved for categorizing the drugs based on their effectiveness using different algorithms. Such categorization can be instrumental for treating illness as well as improve one's health and well-being. Four machine learning algorithms have been applied for binary classification and one for multiclass classification on the drug review dataset acquired from the UCI machine learning repository. The machine learning algorithms used for binary classification are naive Bayes classifier, random forest, support vector classifier (SVC), and multilayer perceptron; among these machine learning algorithms, linear SVC was used for multiclass classification. Results obtained from these four classifier algorithms have been analyzed to evaluate their performances. The random forest has been proven to have the best performance among these four algorithms. However, multiclass classification was found to have low performance when applied to natural language processing. On the contrary, the applied linear SVC algorithm performed better for class 2 with AUC 0.82 in this research.",1

Therefore, engagement activities such as comments have attracted many scholars due its ability to reveal many critical findings, such as the role of users’ sentiment. However, there is a lacuna on how to detect crisis based on users’ sentiment through comments, and for such, we explore framing theory in the study herein to determine users’ sentiment in predicting crisis. Generic content framing theory consists of conflict, economic, human interest, morality, and responsibility attributes frame as independent variables whilst sentiment as dependent variables. Comments from selected Facebook posting case studies were extracted and analysed using sentiment analysis via Application Programme Interface (API) webtool. The comments were then further analysed using content analysis via Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) scale and statistically evaluated using SEM-PLS. Model shows that 44.8% of emotion and reactions towards sensitive issue posting are influenced by independent variables. Only economic consequences and responsibility attributes frame had correlation towards emotion and reaction at p<0.05. News reporting on direction towards economic and responsibility attributes sparks negative sentiment, which proves that it can best be described as pre-crisis detection to assist the Royal Malaysian Police and other relevant stakeholders to prevent criminal activities in their respective social media. © 2023 Watimin et al.

The public's cognition and attitude toward it are of great significance to its actual implementation. A total of 98396 texts related to “double reduction” collected from Sina-Weibo by web crawler technology are investigated to explore the public's cognition and attitude towards the “double reduction” policy as well as its spatio-temporal evolution characteristics. Guided by life cycle theory, the evolution of the public's attitude is studied by sentiment analysis based on the ERINE algorithm and DUTIR. Topics are selected with the adoption of TF-IDF and LDA models to perform spatio-temporal evolution of public cognition and analyze group differences. The results are as follows: the evolution of public concern about the “double reduction” policy is phased and the period of high incidence is closely related to time nodes such as policy release, the new school term, and holidays. There are temporal and spatial differences in the evolution of public attitudes between different stages and groups. Although the public holds a relatively negative attitude, with more information about the “double reduction” policy available, the public's attitude is gradually easing. Topics of public concern vary in different periods, and different groups show different emotional attitudes and have distinctive evolution characteristics of cognitive themes. Compared with other age groups, teenagers pay more attention to topics related to their studies and life. The government's official micro-blog not only shoulders the responsibility of publicizing relevant policies, but also pays close attention to the implementation of relevant policies around the country. The influential groups hold a relatively firm attitude and stable emotions and often can orient public opinions. The regional attention to the “double reduction” policy is positively correlated with the level of local economic development. The research results can help government departments learn about the public's cognition and attitude towards the “double reduction” policy to provide decision-making support, and serve as an important basis for solving existing contradictions and promoting the effective implementation of policies. © 2023",1

Good leadership image in times of a health emergency is paramount to ensure public confidence in governments' abilities to manage the crisis. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify types of image repair strategies utilized by the Malaysian government in their communication about COVID-19 in the media and analyze public responses to these messages on social media. Methods: Content analysis was employed to analyze 120 media statements and 382 comments retrieved from Facebook pages of 2 mainstream newspapers-Berita Harian and The Star. These media statements and comments were collected within a span of 6 weeks prior to and during the first implementation of Movement Control Order by the Malaysian Government. The media statements were analyzed according to Image Repair Theory to categorize strategies employed in government communications related to COVID-19 crisis. Public opinion responses were measured using modified lexicon-based sentiment analysis to categorize positive, negative, and neutral statements. Results: The Malaysian government employed all 5 Image Repair Theory strategies in their communications in both newspapers. The strategy most utilized was reducing offensiveness (75/120, 62.5%), followed by corrective action (30/120, 25.0%), evading responsibilities (10/120, 8.3%), denial (4/120, 3.3%), and mortification (1/120, 0.8%). This study also found multiple substrategies in government media statements including denial, shifting blame, provocation, defeasibility, accident, good intention, bolstering, minimization, differentiation, transcendence, attacking accuser, resolve problem, prevent recurrence, admit wrongdoing, and apologize. This study also found that 64.7% of public opinion was positive in response to media statements made by the Malaysian government and also revealed a significant positive association (P=.04) between image repair strategies utilized by the Malaysian government and public opinion. Conclusions: Communication in the media may assist the government in fostering positive support from the public. Suitable image repair strategies could garner positive public responses and help build trust in times of crisis.",1

Customers typically post reviews on retail websites and various social media platforms about the products or services they purchase, and the reviews may include complaints about the products or services. Automatic detection of consumers' complaints about items or services they buy can be critical for organizations and online merchants since they can use this insight to meet the customers' requirements, including handling and addressing the complaints. Previous studies on Complaint Identification (CI) are limited to text. Images posted with the reviews can provide cues to identify complaints better, thus emphasizing the importance of incorporating multi-modal inputs into the process. Furthermore, the customer's emotional state significantly impacts the complaint expression since emotions generally influence any speech act. As a result, the impact of emotion and sentiment on automatic complaint identification must also be investigated. One of the major contributions of this work is the creation of a new dataset- Complaint, Emotion, and Sentiment Annotated Multi-modal Amazon Reviews Dataset (CESAMARD), a collection of opinionated texts (reviews) and images of the products posted on the website of the retail giant Amazon. We present an attentionbased multi-modal, adversarial multi-task deep neural network model for complaint detection to demonstrate the utility of the multi-modal dataset.

As a result, it's critical to create aspect-based opinion mining frameworks that focus on obtaining consumers' feature-based judgments about products. Nowadays people convey their opinions and provide their experiences that significantly affect new purchasers in buying products, thus it leads to maintenance of large data sets. This massive amount of data is extremely beneficial for studying user preferences, desires, and behavior in relation to a product. E-commerce service providers face the difficult task of evaluating such vast amounts of data in order to derive client feedback. In order to resolve this issue, we explored Hypergraph with Helly property to perform emotion aware aspect-based opinion mining on real-world customer review data. In this paper, we are proposing a new distributed Hypergraph with Helly property algorithm for opinion mining to work on distributed Hadoop environment. Because of the large size data set, the suggested feature-based opinion mining system surpasses the alternative approaches in terms of greater accuracy and less time complexity, according to the performance evaluation using state-of-the-art methods.

It is part of the information system belonging to Catalonia's primary care service. It has been in operation since the end of 2015 in conjunction with face-to-face consultations with Primary Care Teams as one of the services offered in the patient's Personal Health Folder. Objective: This study aimed to assess the ability of using eConsulta to reduce the number of face-to-face visits to Primary Care Teams. Methods: Using 13 categories proposed by the researchers, 18 GPs from the Central Catalonia Health Region retrospectively classified 2268 cases managed with eConsulta and indicated whether, in their opinion, the teleconsultations reduced the number of face-to-face visits. Results: There was broad consensus among the GPs that eConsulta has the potential to resolve patient queries for every type of consultation. eConsulta avoided the need for a face-to-face visit in 87.9% of cases. In addition, the GPs reported that the ease of access increased the demand for health care support in 27.7% of cases; otherwise, the patient would not have initiated the queries. Therefore, based on the equation (88% x [1-28%]), eConsulta could replace 63%-88% of conventional appointments. The most frequent uses of the teleconsultation service were for management of test results (35.2%), medical enquiries (16.0%), and the management of repeat prescriptions (12.2%). On average, the teleconsultations consisted of a mean 1.57 messages (SD 0.54 messages); 45.9% (1040/2268) of the teleconsultations consisted of 1 message, and the majority of the remaining teleconsultations consisted of 2-5 interactions. The patient initiated 60.0% (1361/2268) of the teleconsultations. Conclusions: Based on the GPs' perceptions, eConsulta could replace 63%-88% of conventional appointments. Therefore, asynchronous teleconsultations between practitioners and patients in primary care could avoid interactions that have limited added clinical value.",0

It is feasible to see how traditional media is undergoing changes and processes that diminish the importance of the traditional 'editing office' and place a growing focus on journalists' remote labour.As a result, social media has evolved into a component of national security since fake news and disinformation spread by nefarious individuals can influence readers and spark pointless debates on social issues that are inherently unimportant. This has a domino effect, instils dread in the populace, and eventually puts the security of the state in jeopardy.Recently, deep machine learning techniques have proven to be one of the technologies thought to be an effective way to combat the false news problem. However, due to shortages of labelled data, these methods often have poor model generalization capabilities when applied in real-world cases.In this paper, we address this problem by utilizing lightweight model stitching, which serves as a foundation for a hybrid method for fake news detection. Six distinct benchmark datasets have been used in our varied experiments. The outcomes are promising and pave the way for additional studies. © 2023 IEEE.",0

AutoNotes is an android application that converts the speech of the instructor to text in real time during the lecture and then it synchronizes this text to the original lecture slides to produce new slides annotated with the explanation of the instructor. These new lecture slides can be displayed in a classroom. Moreover, it can be accessed by the students on their mobile phones. AutoNotes also provides a feature for the students who like to write their notes with their own way. A focus group was conducted to gather target audience opinions. The results have shown that students liked the idea of AutoNotes. They saw it beneficial for them especially if the original lecture slides are not detailed. They also like the idea of putting the notes with its corresponding slide. To evaluate AutoNotes, a between group design setup of two identical lectures with different groups of participants was conducted. In the first lecture, the lecturer used the original lecture slides. However, in the second one the annotated lecture slides was used. The participants were given several tests to compare their overall learning experiences. The results of the tests reveal that the participants that were exposed to the annotated lecture slides had a higher engagement level and learning gain than the other group exposed to the original lecture slides. Additionally, they had a workload level less than the other group. For the system usability test, the average usability scale that AutoNotes got is 78 which can be considered above average. Finally, the results of the accuracy testing reveal that the accuracy of the speech recognition was 83.2%. The precision and recall metrics were used to evaluate the synchronization of the speech with the slides. The average precision score was 75.6 %. However, the average recall score was 51.1%.",0

Using a combination of automated and manual methods of content analysis, this chapter goes beyond the existing studies to examine how the Eurozone crises impacted the traditional media coverage of the EU not only in terms of magnitude but also in terms of framing and content. Using a unique dataset of 165,341 news items, from 12 mainstream newspapers, this study answers three questions relevant to the main goal of this book: (1) does EU politicisation vary between left- and right-leaning newspapers; (2) is there a difference between news and opinion articles in terms of EU salience and tone; (3) what dimensions of EU debates are more prevalent in the media. Our analysis shows that, after the crisis, the countries’ politicisation of the EU diverged more in terms of content than magnitude. However, when we only consider opinion articles, the differences within mainstream media, from the left and right, become more salient. These results confirm the role and importance of the media for EU politicisation and its potential impact on national politics. © 2023, The Author(s).",0

Aiming at the shortcomings of sentiment dictionaries or machine learning methods in sentiment analysis tasks, this paper builds a sentiment classification model based on deep learning methods. First, the current main text preprocessing methods are introduced, and then a sentiment classification model, BCBL, is proposed, combining BERT, CNN, and Bi LSTM. Compared with traditional models, BCBL can better complete text sentiment classification tasks on standard datasets. Next, in view of the problem that BCBL does not consider the distribution of vocabulary weights, an attention mechanism is introduced to improve BCBL, and then the BCBL-Att model is proposed. Set up multiple sets of comparative experiments again and find that the classification effect and overall performance of BCBL-Att on standard datasets are better than BCBL, indicating that BCBL-Att has more advantages in text sentiment classification tasks.",1

As one of the most common ways of communication, dialogue contains rich information and sentiment expression of participants. Dialogue sentiment classification and dialogue act recognition arc two sub-tasks in dialogue systems that aim to predict the sentiment and act label of each utterance in a dialogue. In the past few years, these two tasks gained attention from the NLP community due to the increase of public availability of dialogue data. They can be used to analyze dialogues that take place on social media or other scenes and provide support for downstream tasks, such as dialogue response generation. They can also aid in analyzing dialogues in real times, which can be public opinion monitoring, interviews, psychological consulting and more. These two tasks are influenced by multiple factors and closely related. However, existing models do not make reasonable use of the explicit and implicit information contained in a dialogue, such as speaker information, temporal information, and label information,and simply or coarse-grained modeling the interaction of two tasks. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a new multi-task learning model, namely Speaker-aware Cross-task Co-interactive Graph Network (SA-CCGN). The model first captures speaker-aware sentiment and act cues along with the time to generate speaker-aware utterance representations, and then adequately models information propagation within a conversation and information interaction between tasks through a cross-task co-interactive graph network, where information propagation of a conversation is modeled by constructing a directed acyclic graph, and after each graph propagation, appropriate interaction between two tasks is performed using the co-interactive layer. Finally, the label information is introduced, i. e., differentiation and correlation between labels, which can constrain the model training when decoding. Specifically, in the multi-loss decoder, the supervised contrastive learning loss is used to make the learned representation of different labels more differentiated and the conditional random field loss is used to constrain the generation of adjacent label sequences, then the final sentiment and act label of each utterance arc obtained. In order to prove the effectiveness of the model in this paper, experiments were conducted on the two public two-way dialogue datasets: DailyDialog dataset and Mastodon dataset, and we compare our proposed method with a variety of state-of-the-art methods, including dialogue sentiment classification methods, dialogue act recognition methods and joint-train methods. Experimental results on two public datasets show that our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art joint model Co-GAT, with an improvement of 4. 57% and 3. 33% in Fl scores for the dialogue sentiment classification task and 2. 15% and 0. 63% in Fl scores for the dialogue act recognition task on the two datasets, respectively, while reducing the number of parameters and memory usage by about 1/2. The performance of SA-CCGN on two public datasets exceeds the best results in the known literature. Experiments show that this method can effectively utilize dialogue information, and has obvious advantages in dialogue sentiment classification task and dialogue act recognition task compared to previous methods. © 2023 Science Press.

Existing studies usually consider the detection of partial sentiment elements, instead of predicting the four elements in one shot. In this work, we introduce the Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction (ASQP) task, aiming to jointly detect all sentiment elements in quads for a given opinionated sentence, which can reveal a more comprehensive and complete aspect-level sentiment structure. We further propose a novel PARAPHRASE modeling paradigm to cast the ASQP task to a paraphrase generation process. On one hand, the generation formulation allows solving ASQP in an end-to-end manner, alleviating the potential error propagation in the pipeline solution. On the other hand, the semantics of the sentiment elements can be fully exploited by learning to generate them in the natural language form. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the superiority of our proposed method and the capacity of crosstask transfer with the proposed unified PARAPHRASE modeling framework.",1

Objective Our objective was to develop a computerized algorithm that can reliably identify DILI cases from the EMR. Methods The EMR was searched for all encounters with an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) T code for drug toxicity and a K-71 code for toxic liver injury between 1 October 2015 and 30 September 2018. Clinically significant liver injury was defined using predetermined laboratory values. An expert opinion causality score (1-3 = probable DILI, 4/5 = non-DILI), Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) score, and severity score was assigned to each case. Results Among the 1,211,787 encounters searched, 517 had both an ICD-10 T code and a K-71 code, with 257 patients meeting the laboratory criteria. After excluding 75 cases of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity, the final study sample included 182 cases of potential DILI, with antineoplastics and antibiotics being the most frequently implicated agents. Causality assessment identified probable DILI in 121 patients (66.5%), whereas 61 (33.5%) had an alternative cause of liver injury. Although age, sex, race, and suspect drugs were similar, the probable DILI cases were more likely to present with a hepatocellular injury profile and have more severe liver injury than the non-DILI cases (p < 0.05). Conclusion A computerized algorithm based on a combination of ICD-10 codes identified 182 potential DILI cases with 121 true positives, 61 false positives, and a positive predictive value of 66.5%. Future studies incorporating natural language processing may further improve the utility of this algorithm in identifying high-causality idiosyncratic DILI cases.",0

The existing opinion mining detection schemes were used to determine the status of product’s performance, wherein information is disseminated (positive or negative), even though the existing methods did not provide high accuracy and also increase the computational complexity and computation time. To overcome these issues, a deep non-linear and unbiased deep decisive pooling (N-UDDP) learning is proposed in this paper for getting accurate opinion mining of customer review. Initially, the customer reviews are taken from Amazon dataset. Then, the customer reviews are given as input to N-UDDP learning for getting accurate opinion mining of customer review. The proposed N-UDDP learning contains skip-gram input layer, non-linear ReLU-enabled activation function layer, and unbiased decisive pooling layer. The skip-gram input layer is utilized to obtain the computationally efficient features from input customer review. The non-linear ReLU-enabled activation function layer is used to obtain the unique and relevant features through eigenvector generation. Finally, the mining accuracy can be improved via unbiased decisive pooling layer by explicitly incorporating their confidence over the pooling function through decisive rules. Initially, the customer reviews are taken from Amazon dataset.

It extends its application to making decisions about our day-to-day activities. The text reviews consist of enormous, sparse, non-uniform distribution of words represented as features. Text mining is the backend process for those applications. It includes techniques such as feature representation, sentiment classification, feature optimization, etc. Analysing the opinions suggested by the experienced people as positive and negative reviews is a challenging process and it is the baseline of our work. This paper contributes to the related processes involved in analysing the sentiments from the text reviews and accurately classifying them based on their polarity. In the proposed work, we particularly focus on feature representation techniques that have a major effect on enhancing the performance of sentiment classification. We explore different feature representation models such as TF-IDF vectorizer, word2vec vectorizer, and glove vectorizer as these word embedding models are interpreting the words and their syntactic and semantic relationships differently from the corpus. Also, we employ machine learning algorithms and a deep convolution neural network to perform comparative studies in classifying the sentiments.

On the other side, the availability of online data, such as social media and intellectual property, has the potential to identify and prioritize product, technology, and supplier opportunities in a cost-effective, quick, and real-time manner. This study proposes an online data-driven concurrent product, process, and supply chain design (3DCE) for linking customer requirements to potential technology and supplier opportunities in early-stage new product development. Three case studies on the leading smartphone industry demonstrate the proposed method's feasibility and effectiveness. To identify customer requirements, opinions from social media data are collected. Product opportunities are developed using latent Dirichlet allocation to identify product topics and sentiment analysis to assess satisfaction levels. Then, a novel approach by association rule mining is developed to mine specific customer requirements for each promising topic. In the 3DCE approach, the potential technology and supplier opportunities are tailored to specific customer requirements based on intellectual property mining.

Design/methodology/approach In this study, text mining is used for automatic extraction of valuable information from textual data such as the financial reports of firms. Instead of expert opinions, linguistic scales built upon outcomes of text mining are used as inputs for decision-making. The proposed model combines fuzzy DEMATEL (FDEMATEL), fuzzy ANP (FANP), fuzzy TOPSIS (FTOPSIS) and fuzzy VIKOR (FVIKOR) methods for weighting criteria and ranking alternatives. Findings Using data from five privatized firms in Turkey, the study's findings demonstrate that the customer is the most important dimension of brand equity performance evaluation. Cash flow and brand loyalty are identified as the most important criteria in the measurement of brand equity performance. Practical implications Findings highlight the importance of firms taking action to increase consumer perceptions, attitudes and behaviors in the privatization processes. For this purpose, privatized firms need to understand the expectations of customers to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty and therefore improve brand equity. Originality/value The paper contributes to literature in several important ways. First, by adopting the BSC approach, it proposes a holistic and a multidimensional model for measuring brand equity performance. Second, the study offers a novel methodology using a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making model designed for the fuzzy environment.

Social media sites can be a valuable tool for public health officials to conduct informational health campaigns. Current social media platforms provide researchers with opportunities to better identify and target specific audiences and even individuals. However, we are not aware of systematic research attempting to identify audiences with mixed or ambivalent views toward HTS. Objective: The objective of this study was to (1) confirm previous research showing positively skewed HTS sentiment on Twitter using a larger dataset by leveraging machine learning techniques and (2) systematically identify individuals who exhibit mixed opinions about HTS via the Twitter platform and therefore represent key audiences for intervention. Methods: We prospectively collected tweets related to HTS from January to June 2016. We double-coded sentiment for a subset of approximately 5000 randomly sampled tweets for sentiment toward HTS and used these data to train a machine learning classifier to assess the remaining approximately 556,000 HTS-related Twitter posts. Natural language processing software was used to extract linguistic features (ie, language-based covariates). The data were processed by machine learning tools and algorithms using R. Finally, we used the results to identify individuals who, because they had consistently posted both positive and negative content, might be ambivalent toward HTS and represent an ideal audience for intervention. Results: There were 561,960 HTS-related tweets: 373,911 were classified as positive and 183,139 were classified as negative. A set of 12,861 users met a priori criteria indicating that they posted both positive and negative tweets about HTS. Conclusions: Sentiment analysis can allow researchers to identify audience segments on social media that demonstrate ambiguity toward key public health issues, such as HTS, and therefore represent ideal populations for intervention. Using large social media datasets can help public health officials to preemptively identify specific audience segments that would be most receptive to targeted campaigns.",1

This research work augments heuristic-driven user interest profiling with reviewer credibility analysis and fine-grained feature sentiment analysis to devise a robust recommendation methodology. The proposed credibility, interest and sentiment enhanced recommendation (CISER) model has five modules namely candidate feature extraction, reviewer credibility analysis, user interest mining, candidate feature sentiment assignment and recommendation module. Review corpus is given as an input to the CISER model. Candidate feature extraction module uses context and sentiment confidence to extract features of importance. To make our model robust to fake and unworthy reviews and reviewers, reviewer credibility analysis proffers an approach of associating expertise, trust and influence scores with reviewers to weigh their opinion according to their credibility. The user interest mining module uses aesthetics of review writing as heuristics for interest-pattern mining. The candidate feature sentiment assignment module scores candidate features present in review based on their fastText sentiment polarity. Finally, the recommendation module uses credibility weighted sentiment scoring of user preferred features for purchase recommendations. The proposed recommendation methodology harnesses not only numeric ratings, but also sentiment expressions associated with features, customer preference profile and reviewer credibility for quantitative analysis of various alternative products. The mean average precision (MAP@1) for CISER is 93% and MAP@3 is 49%, which is better than current state-of-the-art systems.",0

Sentiment analysis is a technique used to determine the polarity of opinions expressed in a text. The more complex stage of sentiment analysis is known as Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), where it is possible to ascertain both the actual topics being discussed by the speakers as well as the polarity of each opinion. Nowadays, people leave comments on a variety of websites, including social networking sites, online news sources, and even YouTube video comment sections, on a wide range of topics. ABSA can play a significant role in utilizing these comments for a variety of objectives, including academic, commercial, and socioeconomic development. In English and many other popular European languages, there are many datasets for ABSA, but the Bengali language has very few of them. As a result, ABSA research on Bengali is relatively rare. In this paper, we present a Bengali dataset that has been manually annotated with five aspects and their corresponding sentiment. A baseline evaluation was also carried out using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, with 97% aspect detection accuracy and 77% sentiment classification accuracy. For aspect detection, the F1-score was 0.97 and for sentiment classification, it was 0.77.",1

When this kind of input is lacking, the overall approach of the service provider can shift in unintended ways. These services rely on feedback to maintain consumer satisfaction. Online social networks are a rich source of consumer data related to services and products. Well developed methods like sentiment analysis can offer insightful analyses and aid service providers in predicting outcomes based on their reviews-which, in turn, enables decision-makers to develop effective strategic plans. However, gathering this data is more challenging on Arabic online social networks, due to the complexity of the Arabic language and its dialects.

"14571","Analysis and Recognition Method of Internet Image Public Opinion Based on Partial Differential Equation","Zhang, Yang",2021,"ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS","Article","This article comprehensively and systematically expounds the development trends and basic theory of partial differential methods, analyzes the characteristics of sampling multiscale transformation in detail, and deeply studies the network image denoising and network image restoration methods that perform partial differential diffusion in the pixel domain and the transform domain. An adaptive diffusion method of partial differential equations is proposed. Among them, the key parameters can be adaptively changed according to the curvature and gradient of the local geometric information of the network image, and the diffusion direction and intensity of the diffusion can be controlled. First, using the principle of variation, we derive the Euler equation corresponding to the diffusion method of partial differential equations and analyze its diffusion ability using the local orthogonal coordinate system of the network image. Based on the theoretical analysis of public opinion, this article applies opinion mining technology to the online public opinion early warning system to achieve the purpose of grasping the opinions of netizens in time and guiding the trend of public opinion. Opinion mining is the use of natural language processing technology to automatically extract the emotional tendencies and evaluation objects contained in the subjective text. In the edge area of the network image, the diffusion along the edge direction should have a large diffusion coefficient, and the diffusion along the vertical edge direction should have a small diffusion coefficient; in the flat area of the network image, it diffuses to the surrounding with equal intensity, and the diffusion intensity value is relatively high. Secondly, based on the analysis of the adaptive partial differential equation diffusion method, using the half-point difference format, a numerical method for network image recognition is designed. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the network image recognition model based on adaptive partial differential equation diffusion is more effective than the model based on partial differential equation recognition; at the same time, experiments show that the network image recognition model based on adaptive partial differential equation diffusion is more effective than the network image recognition model based on ordinary diffusion. The network image recognition model based on constant partial differential equation diffusion is more effective in improving the quality of network image recognition.",1

This behavior affects both policy-making agendas and the party members' communications with the media and constituents. While there has been ample study of partisan influence on legislative agenda-setting and roll call voting behavior, much less is known about the parties' efforts to shape the public debate. This paper analyzes two strategic decisions of parties: the timing of collective efforts to influence the public policy debate and the substantive content of these party messaging events. These dynamics are analyzed using a unique dataset of 50,195 one-minute speeches delivered on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1989 to 2016. We find a pattern of strategic matching-both parties are more likely to engage in concurrent messaging efforts, often on the same issue.",0

Apart from explicit sentiment features, extracting implicit sentiment features is a challenging research issue. The sentiment expression is very domain-specific, and constructing a general sentiment lexicon that is suitable for all domains is hard or even impossible. In this paper, we propose a novel sentiment unit context propagation framework to extract Chinese microblog-specific explicit and implicit sentiment features. In the process of the selection of seed sentiment units, we select the seed sentiment units that have a large standard degree of centrality with other units, and mark these units with sentiment labels using general sentiment lexicons and manual calibrations. To realize sentiment label propagation from a small amount of labeled sentiment units to unlabeled ones, we exploit local contexts, topic features, and social relationships among users in microblog social networks. After that, the sentiment scores of units are calculated using unit context sentiment propagation. Experiments on two real-world microblog data sets demonstrate that our method can generate microblog-specific sentiment lexicons effectively. Furthermore, the sentiment classification accuracies significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0

Over the years technology has significantly changed the way people communicate. How they feel, what they like or dislike, people like to share it online. Proper mining and analysis of public feelings or opinions can bring a miracle to existing business profit. For the same purpose instead of exclusive public opinion polling, machine learning tools are preferred. Few researchers are trying to interpret it with the help of linguistic approach. But the reviews or opinion of the customers' also known as user-generated content has the characteristics such as incomplete, grammatically incorrect, weakly structured etc. This causes degradation in the performance of the opinion mining task. Whereas, few researchers are trying to apply statistical measures for the same. Both the methods have their own pros and cons. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid approach by integrating both the linguistic as well as statistics approach into a single unified framework. The key objective of our task is to co-extract the feature and opinion pair from customers reviews. Let's view the unstructured corpus a combination of a set of grammatically correct and a set of grammatically incorrect sentences. For the grammatically correct sentence, use syntactic pattern-based rules to extract the features and opinion pairs. For the set of sentences not interpreted by the syntactic parser, apply word alignment technique to extract probable feature opinion pair. Further, we determine the aspect of each probable feature and calculate the opinion association among these words. Finally, we calculate the soundness of extracted feature opinion pair with the document. For experimentation purpose, we used customer review dataset of five different products. Through the analysis, a high accuracy is achieved by the hybrid approach.",1

Drawing on the two-factor theory, this paper aims to mine ODRs to explore the different determinants of patient satisfaction (PS) and patient dissatisfaction (PD) toward the United Kingdom healthcare services. This study collects reviews from a publicly available medical website Iwantgreatcare.org from January 2014 to December 2018, followed by the text mining method based on combining SentiNet and LDA to disclose the semantics of patients? healthcare experiences. The proposed method found latent topics across the high-risk and low-risk disease category that revealed new insights into what patients value when consulting a physician and what they dislike. For high-risk and low-risk diseases, the determinants of PS were more specific to the hospital business process (hospital environment, location, hospital cafeteria servicescape, parking availability, and medical process, etc.) and doctor-related aspects (physician knowledge, competence, and attitudes, etc.). In contrast, patients? concerns were most commonly related to their treatment experience and staff bedside manners for both disease categories. Finally, the classification results revealed that the proposed model, which analyzes patient opinion toward different aspects of care, outperformed other stateof-the-art models, with the highest classification F1-score of 88%. The study findings provide a clue for doctors, hospitals, and government officials to enhance PS and minimize PD by addressing their needs and improve the quality of care across different types of diseases, particularly in the current pandemic era of COVID-19.",1

Sarcasm detection is a significant challenge for sentiment analysis because sarcasm involves a positive expression with negative meaning. Previous work focused on relation information between pairs of role expressions, such as boss and staff, and proposed a sarcasm detection method based on surface and relation information. Although they showed the effectiveness of the relation information, due to the small scale of the list of role pairs, the effectiveness was limited to a small scale. In this paper, we attempt to improve the performance of the sarcasm detection method. We propose a role pair extraction method using a bootstrap method to obtain a larger role pair list than the previous work. In addition, we propose weighting methods for each role pair. Then, we evaluate the method using our role pair list and weighting methods by comparing the method using the list of the previous work. We find that we can obtain approximately threefold increase for role pairs. Although the effectiveness is limited, the experimental result shows a potential benefit because the method with topic similarity can reduce the influence of such noise pairs.",0

Existing studies have predicted the success of newly launched automobiles based on an economic perspective. However, factors such as dynamic changes in consumer preferences and the emergence of numerous automobile brands pose difficulty in understanding product quality. This study proposes a method of understanding the automotive market using text mining techniques and online user opinions for newly launched cars. By analyzing customer experiences and expectations through their opinions, we can anticipate automobile demand in the market more easily. The proposed method is based on online reviews from an online portal for automobiles. Based on a literature review, this study presents a framework for analyzing input versus output word-of-mouth (WOM). It also integrates the success factors from existing automobile studies and derives functional categories and relevant keywords. The analysis identifies differences in consumer-interest factors that lead to short-term success or normal results in automobile sales. In addition, it confirms that the elements of WOM produces varying results depending on the timing these are employed in relation to the product launch (i.e., before or after a product???s launch). It revealed which dimensions of automobile characteristics are important factors in identifying sales volume and market share for specific types and brands of automobile models. The results of this study provide theoretical advantage in predicting market success in the automobile industry. In addition, the study derives practical insights into characteristics of classification information for market forecasts in the automotive industry. The paper provides empirical insights about how input WOM and output WOM which are analyzed differently can have predictive power in forecasting market share and sales volume for automobiles.",1
"17175","The Rite of Passage in Karay Turks: Marriage","Atmaca, Emine",2023,"MILLI FOLKLOR","Article","It is a fact that Turks have accepted various belief systems such as Kok Tengri, Totemism, Animism, Shamanism (in Siberian and Central Asian Turkic communities), Buddhism, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, Is-lam, Christianity, and Judaism. This reveals that the Turks have been in a very wide geographical and cultural spectrum. Historians of religions state that adopting these various belief systems is the result of the geography in which the majority of Turks live and their social and cultural interactions. Derived from the word 'kara- (K- R -A)'meaning 'those who read' in the Aramaic-Hebrew language, which is considered a sect of Judaism that emerged in the Middle Ages within this religious diversity, Karaism has become the name of a noble Turkish community over time. The Karaites, who claim to be the remnants/descendants of the Khazar State, are a Turk-ish tribe belonging to the Karaite sect, who accept only the Torah/Torah (those who recognize the authority of the written law) of Judaism. The Karaites do not acknowledge the Tanakh as the sole source of religious decrees. Therefore, this ethnic group owes its national equality to the general ethnogenesis of religion and language. There are three important phases of human beings, namely 'birth, marriage, and death', which are described as the 'passage'. It is necessary to identify the new state of the person in these transitional periods, to bless him, and at the same time to protect the person from some of the dangers and harmful effects that are believed to be intensified during this time. The customs, traditions, and ceremonies in the transitional periods, as some of the processes and practices included in them, constitute the main stages of the traditional culture of the Turkish noble peoples. Karaite Turkish society also attaches great importance to marriage, being one of these transition periods, as in other Turkish tribes, and implements various practices in their own way within the framework of the Karai belief system. These rituals applied in marriage have an important function in the continuity of their traditions and customs, ensuring the connection between the old and new generations, and maintaining unity and harmony for the Karaites. The Karays are in danger of extinction because they do not have a positive opinion of marriages from different religions (other Muslim, Christian, and Buddhist Turkish tribes) and Jewish sects (Rabbanists). This situation enabled them to preserve their identity more than other Turkish tribes and to lean on their culture more. So much so that, since their dialects are included in the classification called Dialects that are on the verge of extinction, many religious, cultural, and grammatical books have been prepared in order to keep the Karaite dialect alive. In this study, both the basic beliefs of the Karaites on marriage, which they brought from the roots of the Turkic tree and the rituals that they kneaded with the belief of the Karai sect were examined together. In detecting this information, especially the text and word compilations made by the Karaite Turks residing in Trakai, the old capital of Lithuania, with the data obtained through observation were utilized. In addition, in this study, the similarities in the rituals of the Karaites living in Crimea and the Karaites living in Lithuania, as well as differences due to geography and contact with different cultures are discussed.",0

The profusion of data generated through social media has proved to have the potential for improving the efficiency of existing traffic management systems and transportation analytics. This study complements existing literature by proposing a framework to evaluate transit riders' opinion about quality of transit service using Twitter data. Although previous studies used keyword search to extract transit-related tweets, the extracted tweets can still be noisy and might not be relevant to transit quality of service at all. In this study, we leverage topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning technique, to sift tweets that are relevant to the actual user experience of the transit system. Sentiment analysis is further performed based on the tweet-pertopic index we developed, to gauge transit riders' feedback and explore the underlying reasons causing their dissatisfaction on the service. This framework can be potentially quite useful to transit agencies for user-oriented analysis and to assist with investment decision making.",1

The sentiment analysis can get the polarity of these opinions, especially in the political domain. However, in Malaysia, current sentiment analysis can be inaccurate when the netizen tempts to use the combination of Malay words in their comments. It is due to the insufficient Malay corpus and sentiment analysis tools. Therefore, this study aims to construct a multistage sentiment classification model based on Malaysia Political Ontology and Malay Political Corpus. The reviews are carried out in sentiment analysis, classification techniques, Malay sentiment analysis, and sentiment analysis on politics. It starts with the data preparation for Malay tweets to produce tokenized Malay words and then, the construction of corpus using corpus filtering, web search, and filtering using linguistic patterns before enhancing with political lexicons. The process continues with the classifier construction. It started with a generic ontology with Malaysia's political context. Lastly, twelve features are identified.

These data full of sentiment information bear significant relevance to multiple applications. However, the extraction of text sentiment relies heavily on text representation methods, and conventional methods are inadequate for short text segments that are commonly encountered in social media. In light of this, we propose an adversarial variational Bayes classifier for short text sentiment classification. To improve the delicate and unstable training process of the discriminator, we employ spectrum normalization, while an additional classifier is integrated to guide the optimization of the inference model, thereby facilitating end-To-end learning from topic modeling to sentiment classification. For better short text representation, we propose three stages of attention weights to achieve the fusion of topic features and pre-Trained word vector features. Qualitative and quantitative experiments have proven that the classifier effectively guides the generation of more discriminative topic features, which are helpful for downstream classification tasks. Empirical results on three real short text datasets demonstrate that our improved model outperforms several baseline methods on short text sentiment classification tasks.  © 2023 IEEE.",0

The classification process relies upon the analysis of the polarity features of the natural language text given by users. Polarity analysis has been an important subtask in sentiment analysis; however, detecting correct polarity has been a major issue. Different researchers have utilized different polarity features, such as standard part-of-speech (POS) tags such as adjectives, adverbs, verbs, and nouns. However, there seems to be a lack of research focusing on the subcategories of these tags. The aim of this research was to propose a method that better recognizes the polarity of natural language text by utilizing different polarity features using the standard POS category and the subcategory combinations in order to explore the specific polarity of text. Several experiments were conducted to examine and compare the efficacies of the proposed method in terms of F-measure, recall, and precision using an Amazon dataset. The results showed that JJ + NN + VB + RB + VBP + RP, which is a POS subcategory combination, obtained better accuracy compared to the baseline approaches by 4.4% in terms of F-measure.",1

A clear majority of people share their opinions about various aspects of their lives online every day. Thus, microblogging websites offer rich sources of data in order to perform sentiment analysis and opinion mining. Because microblogging has emerged relatively recently there are only some research works which are devoted to this field. In this paper, the focus is on performing the task of sentiment analysis using Twitter which is one of the most popular microblogging platforms. Twitter is a very popular microblogging site where its users write status messages called tweets to express themselves. These status updates mostly express their opinions about various topics. The objective of this paper is to build a system that can classify these Twitter status updates as positive, negative, or neutral with respect to any query term thereby giving an idea about the overall sentiment of the people towards that topic. This type of sentiment analysis is useful for advertisers, consumers researching a service or product, companies, governments, marketers, or any organization who are researching public opinion.",1

Not only that, in some cases it is also possible to express sentiments about the different features characterizing those products or services. Most users express sentiments about individual features by using numerical values, which sometimes do not allow users to reflect properly what they are meaning and therefore they are misleading. To overcome this key issue and make users' opinions in online services more comprehensive, a new methodology for representing sentiments using linguistic term sets instead of numerical values is presented. In addition, this methodology will allow to implement importance degrees on the different features characterizing users' opinions. From both sentiments and importance of the features, the most important opinions for each user is derived via an aggregation step based on the Type-1 Ordered Weighted Averaging (T1OWA) operator, which is able to aggregate the corresponding fuzzy set representations of linguistic terms. Furthermore, the final output of the T1OWA based-search process can easily be interpreted by users because it is always of the same type (fuzzy) and defined in the same domain of the original fuzzy linguistic labels. A case study is presented where the T1OWA operator methodology is used to assess different opinions according to different user profiles. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1

To deal with the problem of plastic pollution, the Chinese government issued the Opinions on Further Strengthening the Control of Plastic Pollution (Abbreviated as OFSCPP), which is known as plastic restriction policy by the public, in January 2020. It stipulates the timetable and main tasks for restricting the production, sales, and use of certain plastic products, such as plastic bags, disposable straws and agricultural mulch. Since the policy was officially implemented on January 1, 2021, people's lives in China have been considerably affected, and it has also attracted widespread attention from news media. In this study, 310 pieces of news items and information about the OFSCPP published in the first quarter of 2021 from the Baidu News website from which 44, 94, 90, 26, and 49 statements from producers, retailers, consumers, managers, and experts were extracted. The extracted words and expressions were then analyzed using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model. Text analysis results showed that the production efficiency of plastic substitutes in China cannot meet market demand, consumers' experience on plastic substitutes is poor, and recycling and disposal processing information is opaque. To achieve the policy goals, the government should encourage the innovation of high-quality and inexpensive plastic alternatives, the national standards for plastic substitutes should be urgently improved, consumers' concept of green consumption should be gradually cultivated, and terminal recycling and disposal should be promoted.",0

James C.",2021,"SAFETY SCIENCE","Article","Many studies show that unsafe behavior is the main cause of construction accidents. Safety education and training are effective means to minimise people's unsafe behaviors. Apart from traditional face-to-face construction knowledge sharing, social media is a good tool because it is convenient, efficient, and widely used. We applied both social network analysis and sentiment analysis to investigate knowledge sharing on Twitter. Our study is a novel attempt to understand social structure of construction safety-related twitter networks and the opinion leaders. We selected and analyzed 6561 tweets of three users' networks on Twitter - construction safety, construction health and construction accident. We found that three networks had low density and many isolated vertices, which showed that users did not actively interact with each other. The opinion leaders in this study were mostly organizations or government agencies. The top one is cif_ireland, the Irish construction industry's representative body, the Construction Industry Federation. 3200 Tweets of the top opinion leader were analyzed through graph metrics calculation, cluster analysis, sentiment analysis, and correlation analysis. The opinion leader used Twitter as a medium to disseminate the latest safety news. Thus, we may use Twitter to stimulate people's interest on construction safety topics, share construction safety knowledge, opinions and ideas. Besides, our results showed that sentiment valence had no correlation with number of favorites or retweets. Nevertheless, there was a positive correlation between favorites and retweets.",0

Reviewers' activities in these communities can reflect their interests. Based on the theory of homophily, the authors aim to explore the impacts of the reviewer preference similarity and opinion similarity on the rate of product diffusion.Design/methodology/approachFirst, the authors construct reviewer similarity network based on their common interests and propose typical network metrics to measure reviewer preference similarity. Second, the authors measure reviewer opinion similarity with natural language processing. Finally, based on a panel data from an online video platform in China, both the fixed-effect and random-effect panel data models are constructed.FindingsThe authors find that reviewer preference similarity has a positive effect on the product diffusion, whereas reviewer opinion similarity has a negative effect on the diffusion. Furthermore, temporal distance moderates the relationship between reviewer similarity and the product diffusion. As a double-edged sword, review preference similarity hinders product diffusion in the initial phase, whereas benefits it in the later phase. Reviewer opinion similarity is always detrimental to product diffusion, especially in the initial phase.Originality/valueThis paper extends the understanding of homophily from the micro peer level to the group level by constructing reviewers' similarity network and highlights the important role of reviewer preference similarity and opinion similarity in product diffusion.

Sentiment Analysis (SA) can be explained as the process of identifying the polarity of a given content for gaining an insight into the hidden information stored in a text or a piece of document. Today, various social networking sites serve as a platform for expression. Twitter, is one such microblogging application that is tremendously used by various users for expressing the true intent about a particular entity in the form of tweets. The ultimate goal of analyzing the sentiments is to mine the useful content from these opinion sources. The Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique has been used for the initial processing of tweets. There are broadly two methods available fur further analyzing the opinionated data: Lexicon Based Approach (LBA) and Machine Learning Approach (MLA) based on supervised learning. The Supervised method has a disadvantage of its dependency on the quality and amount of training data. The LBA technique uses an enhanced dictionary i.e. Hindi SentiWordNet as a resource and Hybrid Based Approach (HBA) which combines the LBA and MLA fur classifying movie tweets as either positive or negative. The English language has majorly dominated in this area of research. We, on the other hand, have gathered movie tweets in the Hindi language for Sentiment Analysis of Twitter data and led a comparative evaluation fur both the techniques: LBA and HBA.",1

Sentiment analysis for social media is very important, as it allows information to be obtained about public opinion on government performance. The goal of this research is to learn about the opinions of Surabaya citizens, using deep learning methods. The data are extracted from the official Twitter accounts of the Surabaya government and a private radio station in Surabaya. The data are grouped into two categories: positive and negative sentiments. This research is conducted in three steps: data pre-processing, sentiment classification, and visualization. Data pre-processing is required before modelling approaches are applied. It is used to transform the unstructured text data into structured data. The data pre-processing consists of case folding, tokenizing, and the removal of stop words. Deep learning methods are then applied to the data. A Backpropagation Neural Network (BNN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are used to perform the sentiment classification. The BNN and CNN are compared using various metrics, such as precision, sensitivity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). A word cloud is then used to visualize the data and find the most frequent words in each class. The results show that the sentiment classification with CNN is better than that with the BNN because the values for the precision, sensitivity, and AUC are higher.",1

This knowledge is used to improve decision-making processes. One approach to achieve this is based on the use of lexical knowledge structures. In particular, our aim is to enrich an affective lexicon by the analysis of the similarity relationship between words. The hypothesis of this work states that the similarities of the words belonging to an affective category, with respect to any other word, behave in a homogeneous way within each affective category. The experimental results show that words of a same affective category have a homogeneous similarity with an antonym, and that the similarities of these words with any of their antonyms have a low variability. The novelty of this paper is that it builds the bases of a mechanism that allows incorporating the intensity in an affective lexicon automatically.",0

There is much useful information available on many social networking sites for consumers to make product comparisons. Sentiment analysis is considered appropriate for summarising the opinions. However, the sentences posted online are generally short, which sometimes contains both positive and negative word in the same post. Thus, it may not be sufficient to determine the sentiment polarity of a post by merely counting the number of sentiment words, summing up or averaging the associated scores of sentiment words. In this paper, an unsupervised learning technique, k-means, in conjunction with sentiment analysis, is proposed for assessing public opinions.

With the aim of analyzing the debate in Twitter on the 2016 referendum on the reform of the Italian Constitution, we created an Italian annotated corpus for stance detection for automatically estimating the stance of a relevant number of users. We take into account a diachronic perspective to shed lights on users' opinion dynamics. Furthermore, different types of social network communities, based on friendships, retweets, quotes, and replies were investigated, in order to analyze the communication among users with similar and divergent viewpoints. We observe particular aspects of users' behavior. First, our analysis suggests that users tend to be less explicit in expressing their stances after the outcome of the vote; simultaneously, users who exhibit a high number of cross-stance relations tend to become less polarized or to adopt a more neutral style in the following phase of the debate. Second, despite social media networks are generally aggregated in homogeneous communities, we highlight that the structure of the network can strongly change when different types of social relations are considered. In particular, networks defined by means of reply-to messages exhibit inverse homophily by stance, and users use more often replies for expressing diverging opinions, instead of other forms of communication. Interestingly, we also observe that the political polarization increases forthcoming the election and decreases after the election day.",1

"11959","A Prediction of South African Public Twitter Opinion using a Hybrid Sentiment Analysis Approach","Shackleford, Matthew Brett; Adeliyi, Timothy Temitope; Joseph, Seena",2023,"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS","Article","analysis, a subfield of Natural Language Processing, has garnered a great deal of attention within the research community. To date, numerous sentiment analysis approaches have been adopted and developed by researchers to suit a variety of application scenarios. This consistent adaptation has allowed for the optimal extraction of the authors emotional intent within text. A contributing factor to the growth in application scenarios is the mass adoption of social media platforms and the bondless topics of discussion they hold. For government, organizations and other miscellaneous parties, these opinions hold vital insight into public mindset, welfare, and intent. Successful utilization of these insights could lead to better methods of addressing said public, and in turn, could improve the overall state of public well-being. In this study, a framework using a hybrid sentiment analysis approach was developed. Various amalgamations were created - consisting of a simplified version of the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) lexicon and multiple instances of classical machine learning algorithms. In this study, a total of 67,585 public opinion-oriented Tweets created in 2020 applicable to the South African (ZA) domain were analyzed. The developed hybrid sentiment analysis approaches were compared against one another using well known performance metrics. The results concluded that the hybrid approach of the simplified VADER lexicon and the Medium Gaussian Support Vector Machine algorithms. The Twitter dataset utilized serves to demonstrate model capability, specifically within the ZA context.",1

This paper describes a recent study in which speech-language pathologists were provided with access to a formal language assessment within a telehealth platform and asked to provide feedback about their experiences. Method: Twenty-seven speech-language pathologists in paediatric practice were recruited via callouts on social media, community contacts and professional networks. The participants were provided access to a telehealth platform with a built-in formal language assessment and asked to use the assessment with their own caseload as clinically indicated and provide feedback after each assessment. Questionnaire data was collected via an online survey system and contained questions about each assessment including the most enjoyable and most difficult aspects of the assessment and their overall experience of the platform. Result: More than 100 assessments were completed during the 3-month trial, with clinicians reporting that on most occasions, video and audio quality was adequate or more than adequate, and that interactions with their child clients were effective. Qualitative data indicated that technical difficulties were a drawback to the assessments, but that ease of use of the assessment, the added functionality of using the assessment within the telehealth platform and factors including general benefits of telehealth, particularly that of being able to continue to provide services when face-to-face work was not possible were seen as positive elements. Conclusion: This study adds clinicians' voices to the research into telehealth, indicating that the assessment within the telehealth platform was generally easy to use, and provided an unexpected depth of insight and connection for clinicians and their clients. Future research may consider the voices of other stakeholders in telehealth interactions, including parents and child clients.",0

In this respect, sentiment analysis and opinion mining techniques can be valuable for the automatic analysis of huge textual corpora (comments, reviews, tweets etc.). Despite the advances in text mining algorithms, deep learning techniques, and text representation models, the results in such tasks are very good for only a few high-density languages (e.g., English) that possess large training corpora and rich linguistic resources; nevertheless, there is still room for improvement for the other lower-density languages as well. In this direction, the current work employs various language models for representing social media texts and text classifiers in the Greek language, for detecting the polarity of opinions expressed on social media. The experimental results on a related dataset collected by the authors of the current work are promising, since various classifiers based on the language models (naive bayesian, random forests, support vector machines, logistic regression, deep feed-forward neural networks) outperform those of word or sentence-based embeddings (word2vec, GloVe), achieving a classification accuracy of more than 80%. Additionally, a new language model for Greek social media has also been trained on the aforementioned dataset, proving that language models based on domain specific corpora can improve the performance of generic language models by a margin of 2%. Finally, the resulting models are made freely available to the research community.",1
"12793","AN EMPIRICAL MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH TO EXTRACT AND RANK MULTI-WORD PRODUCT NAMES USING iCIW APPROACH","Sivashankari, R.; Valarmathi, B.",2018,"JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY","Article","Entity Extraction or product name extraction is a suitable premise for sentiment analysis. A sentiment discovers opinion of the customers on the product stated in the sentence. Extracting product names using the existing approaches from the customer's reviews are not exact most of the time. Almost many existing approaches mainly lack in addressing the product name having multiple words or sequence of words (multi-word). When compared with single word named products, extracting opinion on multi-word named products are non-trivial task as customer use either full name or part of the product name (sub-word) in product reviews. Therefore, it is the foremost challenging task in sentiment analysis to recognize appropriate complete name of a specific product using the sub-word names. Secondly, the multi-word named products or sub-word named products may occur anywhere in the review sentences, the position of the product names cannot be predicted in advance. It may occur in the beginning, middle or at the end and also with any number of times. So, identifying the position of these product names is another key issue. Therefore, this research attempt to design a novel automated improved Context Information Weight (iCIW) approach to resolve the exiting issues. The iCIW assimilates the concept of lexicon and statistical approach. The proposed iCIW model is more suitable for document analysis related to medical reports, product details repository and political documents. The experimental result reveals that the proposed method performs very efficient than existing approaches in multi-word named product extraction.",0

Therefore, this paper proposes an event early warning method based on knowledge base and semantic fingerprint. Firstly, based on the idea of data mining, a classified event feature knowledge base is constructed. Next, using Simhash algorithm, a text deduplication method based on semantic fingerprints is proposed, which realizes the noise reduction and simplification of public opinion, and obtains the document feature value after deduplication. Finally, the document features are matched with the features in the knowledge base, realizing event classification and event early warning, facilitating relevant departments to take corresponding measures and reduce social impact.  © 2023 IEEE.",0

However, recent studies were using mostly human effort to extract and encode linguistic patterns to detect such intents from very specific domains (i.e. app reviews and developer emails). In this work, we formalize the problem statement of multi-intent classification for user generated software documents, and propose a Fuzzy Multi-Intent Classifier that can train a classification model on annotated text examples to predict intents using fuzzy logic on matched intent patterns. Our classifier utilizes the novel concept of Lexeme Sequence Pattern which can approximately match to similar text without having a human to encode its Parse Tree.

"16215","Scalable Bayesian preference learning for crowds","Simpson, Edwin; Gurevych, Iryna",2020,"MACHINE LEARNING","Article","We propose a scalable Bayesian preference learning method for jointly predicting the preferences of individuals as well as the consensus of a crowd from pairwise labels. Peoples' opinions often differ greatly, making it difficult to predict their preferences from small amounts of personal data. Individual biases also make it harder to infer the consensus of a crowd when there are few labels per item. We address these challenges by combining matrix factorisation with Gaussian processes, using a Bayesian approach to account for uncertainty arising from noisy and sparse data. Our method exploits input features, such as text embeddings and user metadata, to predict preferences for new items and users that are not in the training set. As previous solutions based on Gaussian processes do not scale to large numbers of users, items or pairwise labels, we propose a stochastic variational inference approach that limits computational and memory costs. Our experiments on a recommendation task show that our method is competitive with previous approaches despite our scalable inference approximation. We demonstrate the method's scalability on a natural language processing task with thousands of users and items, and show improvements over the state of the art on this task. We make our software publicly available for future work (https://github.com/UKPLab/tacl2018-preference-convincing/tree/crowdGPPL).",0

Sentiment analysis establishes the aggregation of these opinions to inform researchers about attitudes towards products or topics. Social network data commonly contain authors' opinions about specific subjects, such as people's opinions towards steps taken to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. Usually, people use dialectal language in their posts on social networks. Dialectal language has obstacles that make opinion analysis a challenging process compared to working with standard language. For the Arabic language, Modern Standard Arabic tools (MSA) cannot be employed with social network data that contain dialectal language. Another challenge of the dialectal Arabic language is the polarity of opinionated words affected by inverters, such as negation, that tend to change the word's polarity from positive to negative and vice versa. This work analyzes the effect of inverters on sentiment analysis of social network dialectal Arabic posts. It discusses the different reasons that hinder the trivial resolution of inverters. An experiment is conducted on a corpus of data collected from Facebook. However, the same work can be applied to other social network posts. The results show the impact that resolution of negation may have on the classification accuracy. The results show that the F1 score increases by 20% if negation is treated in the text.",1

Polarity detection on Twitter by means of machine learning methods is generally affected by the use of irrelevant, redundant, noisy or correlated features, especially when a high-dimensional representation is used in the feature set. There is thus a need for a selection method that removes those features that render the classification algorithm inefficient. In this work, we propose a feature selection method based on the concept of bagging, with two important modifications: (i) the use of covering arrays to support the process of building bootstrap samples; and (ii) the use of the results of rule-induction techniques (JRIP, C4.5, CART or others) to generate the reduced representation of tweets with the features selected. The experimental results show that on using the method proposed, we obtain similar or better results than those obtained with the original representation (this comprising a set of 91 features used in research related to polarity detection in Twitter), bringing the possibility of simpler and faster process models. A subset of features is thereby identified that can facilitate improvements in future polarity detection proposals on Twitter.",0

High morbidity and mortality rates of COVID-19 have been observed among older adults and widely reported in both mainstream and social media. The objective of this study was to analyze tweets related to COVID-19 and older adults, and to identify ageist content. DESIGN We obtained a representative sample of original tweets containing the keywords elderly, older, and/or boomer plus the hashtags #COVID19 and/or #coronavirus. SETTING Tweets posted between March 12 and March 21, 2020. MEASUREMENTS We identified the type of user and number of followers for each account. Tweets were classified by three raters as (1) informative, (2) personal accounts, (3) personal opinions, (4) advice seeking, (5) jokes, and (6) miscellaneous. Potentially offensive content, as well as that downplaying the severity of COVID-19 because it mostly affects older adults, was identified. RESULTS A total of 18,128 tweets were obtained, of which a random sample of 351 was analyzed. Most accounts (91.7%) belonged to individuals. The most common types of tweets were personal opinions (31.9%), followed by informative tweets (29.6%), jokes/ridicule (14.3%), and personal accounts (13.4%). Overall, 72 tweets (21.9%) likely intended to ridicule or offend someone and 21.1% had content implying that the life of older adults was less valuable or downplayed the relevance of COVID-19. CONCLUSION Most tweets related to COVID-19 and older adults contained personal opinions, personal accounts, and jokes. Almost one-quarter of analyzed tweets had ageist or potentially offensive content toward older adults.",0

It is very difficult to manually analyze comments given by the students in response to open-ended questions. This paper proposes a method to extract opinions from students’ feedback that will help to improve the teaching–learning process. It deals with different aspects of teaching i.e. punctuality, the pace of the teaching, subject knowledge, etc. It also incorporates a hybrid approach that combines the lexicon and machine learning approaches. In the lexicon approach, various linguistics features i.e. negation, contact shifters, and modifiers have been considered as these change or add to the orientation of the sentence. SentiWordNet dictionary has been used to assign score to words in the sentences and based on the score, the sentence has been classified as positive, negative, or neutral. After assigning the orientation, the dataset has been resampled using various resampling techniques i.e. ENN, TL, OSS, NCR, SMOTE, ADASYN, Borderline SMOTE, SMOTE-ENN, SMOTE-Tomek, etc. These techniques have been applied to balance the class distribution of each aspect.

By sharing their views, they come to a mutual agreement or disagreement with other users' views. Users are quite active on social media and the number of users is growing exponentially with time. This leads to an abundance of data available through social media. This data helps us in curating different research problems. One such research problem can be finding similarities between users by analyzing user data. Data on social media is available in many forms like textual posts, comments, likes, shares, etc. Users often tend to express their diversity of opinions widely through comments on social media. Many opinionated and active users on social media are found in the comments section under a post. Hence, comments play a major role in determining similarity in user judgment about a topic. Likewise, people liking a post is also an essential feature in finding similarities between users. People with similar opinions tend to like posts of a specific type. This paper talks about how comments, textual posts, and likes for comments can be combined to form something called a keyword or a tag. These tags that are extracted from user data are further used in building a tag network. The tag network is used to make communities of users with similar interests. User grouping can also be done based on these extracted tags and comments under the posts. The proposed methods in this paper to achieve the above-mentioned are TF-IDF (Term frequency-inverse document frequency) followed by the TextRank algorithm. © 2023 IEEE.",0

Data in this domain exhibits complex multi-relational and temporal interactions. Learning from this data is a fundamentally challenging research problem. In this paper, we propose Modal-Temporal Attention Graph (MTAG). MTAG is an interpretable graph-based neural model that provides a suitable framework for analyzing multimodal sequential data. We first introduce a procedure to convert unaligned multimodal sequence data into a graph with heterogeneous nodes and edges that captures the rich interactions across modalities and through time. Then, a novel graph fusion operation, called MTAG fusion, along with a dynamic pruning and read-out technique, is designed to efficiently process this modal-temporal graph and capture various interactions. By learning to focus only on the important interactions within the graph, MTAG achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recognition benchmarks, while utilizing significantly fewer model parameters.(1)",0
"14250","From Hotel Reviews to City Similarities: A Unified Latent-Space Model","Cagliero, Luca; La Quatra, Moreno; Apiletti, Daniele",2020,"ELECTRONICS","Article","A large portion of user-generated content published on the Web consists of opinions and reviews on products, services, and places in textual form. Many travellers and tourists routinely rely on such content to drive their choices, shaping trips and visits to any place on earth, and specifically to select hotels in large cities. In the context of hospitality management, a challenging research problem is to identify effective strategies to explain hotel reviews and ratings and their correlation with the urban context. Under this umbrella, the paper investigates the use of sentence-based embedding models to deeply explore the similarities and dissimilarities between cities in terms of the corresponding hotel reviews and the surrounding points of interests. Reviews and point of interest (POI) descriptions are jointly modelled in a unified latent space, allowing us to deeply investigate the dependencies between guest feedbacks and the hotel neighborhood at different aggregation levels. The experiments performed on public TripAdvisor hotel-review datasets confirm the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.",0

Most research works done on Arabic dialect focus on messages written in Arabic script, with very limited scope on Latin script. In this paper, we are interested in the classification of social networks messages retrieved from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube written in Algerian dialect in Latin script into positive or negative classes using existing opinion mining approaches (lexical-based, machine learning, and hybrid). Also, we apply a regrouping process in the preprocessing step to overcome the issues related to the Algerian dialect such as the orthographic varieties to express the same word. Furthermore, we focus on the hybrid approach which consists in automatically annotating the training corpus with the lexical-based approach and then use the machine learning approach on this corpus for creating the classification model. This approach allows classifying the messages into positive or negative classes, without having to annotate manually a training corpus.",1

Monitoring, forecasting, and responding to public opinion of students in colleges and universities have increasingly become the work that education management departments at all levels attach great importance to. For each university, how to understand the sensation of teachers and students in real time in the era of informationization entering the intelligent campus has become an urgent problem. How to collect college campus network information, analyze and manage this information, and find hot topics from it has a profound impact on the reform of colleges and universities. Hence, in this paper, we propose a public opinion analysis framework based on intelligent data mining technique. Its advantage lies in the fact that it can withdraw the needed and unknown knowledge and regularities from the massive network data and host log data. It is a new attempt to use data mining in achieving public opinion. At present, data mining algorithm applied to public opinion analysis mainly has four basic patterns: association, sequence, classification, and clustering. Data mining technology is advanced for: it can process large amount of data. It does not need the users' subjective evaluation and is more likely to discover the ignored and hidden information. Here, initially, the dataset is collected, which is preprocessed and divided into a training set and test set. Feature extraction of the text is done using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). After that, text cosine similarity calculation is performed to compute the similarity between text vectors obtained from the LDA. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for classification purpose. We proposed Krill Herd Harmony Search Optimization Algorithm (KHHSOA) for optimizing the CNN and classifying the text into positive and negative opinion. The proposed system is simulated using MATLAB simulation tool, and the performance is analyzed in terms of metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, kappa coefficient, and error rate. The proposed method is proved to be better when compared with the existing techniques.",1

Social media is an excellent place to spark conversations or state opinions. Thus, it generates large-scale textual data. In this paper, we harness those data to support the effort of personality measurement. Our first contribution is to develop the Big Five personality trait-based model to detect human personalities from their textual data in the Indonesian language. The model uses an ontology approach instead of the more famous machine learning model. The former better captures the meaning and intention of phrases and words in the domain of human personality. The legacy and more thorough ways to assess nature are by doing interviews or by giving questionnaires. Still, there are many real-life applications where we need to possess an alternative method, which is cheaper and faster than the legacy methodology to select individuals based on their personality. The second contribution is to support the model implementation by building a personality measurement platform. We use two distinct features for the model: an n-gram sorting algorithm to parse the textual data and a crowdsourcing mechanism that facilitates public involvement contributing to the ontology corpus addition and filtering.",0

To better understand why people still engage in this dangerous behavior, we need to assess how the public gets informed about this issue. Knowing that many people use the internet as their primary source of initial research on topics of interest, we conducted an assessment of popular distracted driving videos found on YouTube. Objective: This study aimed to gauge the popularity of distracted driving videos and to assess the messages portrayed by classifying the content, context, and quality of the information available on YouTube. Methods: We conducted a search on YouTube using 5 different phrases related to distracted driving. Videos with more than 3000 views that mentioned or portrayed any aspect of distracted driving were identified, collected, and analyzed. We measured popularity by the number of videos uploaded annually and the number of views and reactions. Two independent researchers reviewed all the videos for categorical variables. Content variables included distractions; consequences; orthopedic injuries; and whether the videos were real accounts, reenactments, fictitious, funny, serious, and graphic. Context variables assessed the setting of the events in the video, and quality of information was measured by the presence of peer-reviewed studies and inclusion and referencing of statistics. Discrepancies in data collection were resolved by consensus via the coding authors. A comparative subanalysis of the 10 most viewed videos and the overall results was also done. Results: The study included a total of 788 videos for review, uploaded to YouTube from 2006 to 2018. An average of 61 videos with greater than 3000 views were uploaded each year (SD 34.6, range 3-113). All videos accumulated 223 million views, 104 million (46.50%) of them being among the 10 most viewed videos. The top 3 distractions depicted included texting, talking on the phone, and eating and/or drinking. Motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) and death were depicted in 742 (94.2%) videos, whereas 166 (21.1%) of the videos depicted injuries. Orthopedic injuries were described in 90 (11.4%) videos. Furthermore, 220 (27.9%) of the videos contained statistics, but only 27 (3.7%) videos referenced a peer-reviewed study. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that there is a high interest in viewing distracted driving videos, and the popularity of these videos appears to be relatively stable over time on a forum that fluxes based on the current opinions of its users. The videos mostly focused on phone-related distractions, overlooking many other equally or more common forms of distracted driving. Death, which in reality is a far less common distracted driving consequence than injuries, was portrayed 1.7 times as much. Surprisingly, orthopedic injuries, which lead to a massive source of long-term disability and often result from MVCs, are vastly underrepresented.",0

Many companies also foresee vast profits in mining data from online interaction, behavior, and activity. Opinion mining, also known as sentiment analysis, means automatically detecting and understanding personal expressions about a product or service from customer textual reviews. Recently, aspect-based sentiment analysis has become widely interesting to researchers, particularly with respect to embedded words. Algorithms such as word2vec and GloVe perform well when it comes to capturing analogies and toward lexical semantics in general. However, more complex algorithms are needed to address this issue more precisely, using larger corpora and special kinds of data. This paper introduces a knowledge representation approach that centers on aspect rating and weighting. The study focuses on how to understand the nature of sentimental representation using a multilayer architecture. We present a model that uses a mixture of semantic and syntactic components to capture both semantic and sentimental information. This model shares its probability foundation with the words recognized by word2vec and builds on our prior work concerning opinion-aspect relation analysis. This new algorithm is designed specifically, however, to discover sentiment-enriched embedding rather than word similarities. Experiments were performed using a review dataset from the electronic domain. Results show that the model achieved both appropriate levels of detail and rich representation capabilities.",1

Since complaint management is recognized as a central for customer satisfaction, any measure of complaint behaviour should consider the degree and quality of the underlying customer satisfaction. Therefore, analyzing customer complaints is part of the process of a business. A prompt, reasonable and efficient response to a complaint can win you a loyal customer, and develop your business's reputation for top quality service. This project would be analysing customer complaints, in order to improve customer experience. As the solution to solve this issue, the proposed solution would address issues with respect to consumer complaint data in a textual format (complaint by phones), which are identified with the IT field (Technical Support Complaints). Furthermore, literary data written in English dialect will be considered. Moreover, SentScore ought to be savvy enough to interpret data identified with complaints efficiently and effectively, classify and analyse sentiment score precisely, summarise them into aspects, and distinguish how the customer feels about those aspects. With this proposed solution the Customer Complaint Operators are able to extract a summarized analysis of the complaint solution by assigning weights to the complaint and aspects including Internet, Television and Facility, which are the main aspect categories considered when analyzing the customer complaint. The system makes utilization of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis concepts, to provide the highest accurate sentiments or opinions expressed by the customer in complaints, to present the end users with accurate and effective summarized outcome of the customer complaints and aspect of it.",1

However, there are little works on how these opportunities can be realized and the challenges in exploiting the opportunities in the transportation industry. Further, data quality and availability using social media may vary according to different demographics due to population size and languages used. Additionally, most of the related prior studies that show the opportunities of using social media data were conducted in North and South America. With this proposition, we seek to investigate the challenges of using Twitter data with text mining techniques for understanding users' opinions and sentiment through a case study of using the data to assess public transportation service performance specifically in a Malaysian context. Our findings indicate that social media data can only be useful in generating reasonable insights if users could input informative words for forming discussed topics to derive opinion, and incline towards a certain sentiment with adjectives. The findings also identified the need for a more proficient dictionary to classify multilingual tweets. Our research provides original evidence proving the potential of using social media data to assess public transportation services performance which may vary depending on the demographics of the social media users.",1

(55797735000)",2023,"ACM International Conference Proceeding Series","Conference paper","In recent years, Recommendation Systems (RSs) have become a vital component of numerous websites and online applications in a variety of domains. Consider, for instance, the e-commerce websites where RSs predominate. In part, the problem of information overload is mitigated by these RSs. However, RSs still have a few issues, such as data sparsity, which leads to another issue known as cold-start. The cold-start problem occurs when the user-item matrix is incredibly sparse. Additionally, RSs has a problem known as the long-tail problem, in which the system is incapable of providing suggestions due to insufficient or invalid ratings for often purchased products. The cold-start problem can be solved by providing recommendations based on captured user preferences and user feedback. User attitudes can be gleaned from the analysis of textual user reviews of purchased products. Sentiment analysis(SA), also known as opinion mining, is the study of people's opinions, feelings, judgments, feedbacks, and emotions conveyed through written language regarding entities and their features. Usually these sentiments are derived and based out of various contexts. A context in sentiment analysis is a mood-based natural attribute. Collaborative filtering (CF) method is by far and away the most popular and widely used algorithm for RSs to date. Collaborative filtering is a way for generating automatic predictions (filtering) about a user's interests by collecting preferences or taste data from a large number of users. In this study, we combine the functionality of a CF algorithm with contextual information extracted from user input. The varied situations are then assessed for sentiment using distinct attributes. Our model is known as FusionSCF. This study utilises two e-commerce datasets: Amazon.com and Flipkart.com. We predict and recommend products to users based on a combined weighted rating and sentiment score. We execute a lexicon-based sentiment analysis utilising several text classification methods for Natural Language Processing. The results reveal that the proposed contextual information sentiment-based model outperforms the conventional collaborative filtering technique. In the final phase of our work, we also explore the consequences of fake reviews on our filtering system. Also using a metric """"genuinity index"""", we convey how reviews can be classified to genuine ones. © 2023 ACM.",1

As a result of the change in status of the Hagia Sophia, there have been discussions on Twitter. Hence, aiming to present text and sentiment analysis of those Tweets, text mining as a sub-branch of data mining is used as a methodology, which is for achieving meaningful information and outputs from raw data by configuring systematic ordering of unstructured data by using natural language processing methods and tools. In this research, 102,430 tweets that include Hagia Sophia as a word and a hashtag from July 10th, 2020 -that the status change of the Hagia Sophia was declared- to June 12th, 2021 are resolved and analyzed using the frequency, sentiment and network analysis. In conclusion, although there are more positive sentiments than the negative ones, the negative sentiment is clearly a discontent and backlash especially against Turkey and Islam. Furthermore, it becomes clear that Islam is associated with terrorism and radicalism.",1

We can process the data with different sentiment analysis techniques to calculate the NHL In the literature, different approaches have been used to calculate NHI, which include the lexicon-based approach and machine learning approach. All of these existing approaches are proposed to calculate NHI for the sentiments written in the English language. However, these methods fail for complex Roman Urdu tweets that contain more than two sub-opinions. There are three primary objectives of the research: (1) to investigate current sentiment analysis techniques are sufficient for the classification of complex Roman Urdu sentiments; (2) to propose rule-based classifier for the classification of Roman Urdu sentiments comprising multiple sub-opinions; (3) to calculate NI-II using Roman Urdu sentiments. For this purpose, we proposed the discourse information extractor, the rule-based method (3-RBC), and the machine learning classifier.

Microblogs are mostly related to real-life events reported in news articles. Finding event-related microblogs is important to analyze online social networks and understand public opinion on events. However, finding such microblogs is a challenging task due to the dynamic nature of microblogs and their limited length. In this study, assuming that news articles are given as queries and microblogs as documents, we find event-related microblogs in Turkish. In order to represent news articles and microblogs, we examine encoding methods, namely traditional bag-of-words and word embeddings provided by BERT and FastText pretrained language models based on deep learning. We find the distance between the encoded news article and microblog to measure text similarity or relatedness between them. We then rank microblogs according to their relatedness to the input query. The experimental results show that (i) BERT-based model outperforms other encoding methods in Turkish, though bag-of-words with Dice similarity has a challenging performance in short text; (ii) news title is successful to represent event as query, and (iii) preprocessing Turkish microblogs has positive impact in bag-of-words and also FastText embeddings, while BERT embeddings are robust to noise in Turkish.",0

Due to the information fragmentation and semantic sparseness of product reviews, it is difficult to capture more comprehensive local information from unstructured texts, which leads to the incorrect extraction of some word pairs. Aimed at the problem, this paper proposes a framework for Attribute-Level Sentiment Element Extraction (ALSEE) towards product reviews. Firstly, a small amount of sample data is selected by random sampling, and multiple features (including part of speech, word distance, dependency relationship and semantic role) which are labelled. The labelled data are used as the training set. Then, the Condition Random Field (CRF) model is applied to extract opinion targets (OT) and opinion words (OW). The self-training strategy is used to achieve the semi-supervised learning of CRF model through iterative training. Finally, target-opinion word pairs with modifying relationship are obtained by dependency parsing.

New techniques are therefore needed to handle these huge amounts of data to find the hidden information thus improve the results of the analysis. We are developing a framework for the analysis of heterogeneous data using machine learning (ML) techniques. In contrast to most of the literature frameworks that focus on a specific type of heterogeneous data for evaluating the proposed framework, we have analyzed 15k tweets data from six American airlines. These tweets are collected from the open stream of Twitter, also predict, classify each tweet as a negative or positive review, and test the ability of deep learning (DL) algorithms by comparing it with traditional ML algorithms. The findings confirmed the validity of the proposed framework and helped to achieve the study objective by providing excellent analysis performance and provide insights into additional aspects of information extraction from heterogeneous data.",1

Static word embeddings such as word2vec are powerful for handling large amounts of text, while contextualized word embeddings from transformer-based models yield better embeddings by some evaluation metrics. In this study, we explore the differences between static and contextualized embeddings for word-based analysis of opposing opinions. We find that pre-training is necessary for static embeddings when the corpus is small, but contextualized embeddings are superior. When the focus corpus is large, static embeddings reflect related concepts, while contextualized embeddings often show synonyms or cohypernyms. Static embeddings trained only on the focus corpus capture opposing opinions better than contextualized embeddings. © 2023 IEEE.",1

We identified the highly cited books in Scopus and compared the citations with ratings and reviews on the Goodreads website. R stat was used to extract the data from Goodreads website. We found that there is an uneven distribution of Goodreads rating and reviews. Social science books received the highest number of user's ratings, reviews and citations. The study finds that there is no relationship between citation counts and Goodreads ratings and reviews count in social science books. Although social science books generated the highest number of studies and engagement by the readers, there seems to be no evidence to suggest that this engagement results in an academic citation. Whereas, a correlation was observed between health science books citations and Goodreads overall rating, as with physical science book reviews and Google Scholar citation counts.",0

However, it is challenging to mine domain features from the user reviews. In this paper, a novel Domain Feature Miner (DOFM) is designed by (i) formulating the feature mining problem as a clustering problem and (ii) engaging three newly conceived empirical observations such as frequency count, grouping semantics, and distributional statistics of features. Later, Symmetric Cluster Extraction (SCE) and Asymmetric Cluster Extraction (ACE) algorithms are designed to identify domain features from clusters. The effectiveness of the DOFM is verified on benchmarks provided by the University of Illinois at Urbana?Champaign and compared with the four state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches using Precision, Recall, and F-score. Moreover, ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation), a well-known package for automatic evaluation of summaries is used to evaluate the DOFM generated summaries. The Error Analysis reveals that at least one of three annotators would prefer 84% sentences of all DOFM generated summaries, while 36% sentences are preferred by all three. This indicates the robustness of DOFM in domain feature retrieval and extractive summarization.",0

Homogeneity in conspiracy-related discussion networks on YouTube","Roechert, Daniel; Neubaum, German; Ross, Bjorn; Stieglitz, Stefan",2022,"INFORMATION SYSTEMS","Article","In many instances, misinformation among the population manifests itself in the form of conspiracy theories. Services such as YouTube, which allow the publication of audiovisual material in juxtaposition with peer responses (e.g., comments), function as ideal forums to disseminate such conspiracy theories and reach a massive audience. While previous research provided initial evidence about the prevalence of conspiracy theories in social media, it remains unclear how online networks discussing conspiracist content are structured. Knowledge about the network structure, however, could indicate to what extent people discussing conspiracist ideas face the risk of becoming caught in homogeneous communication cocoons. This work presents an approach combining natural language processing and network analysis to measure opinion-based homogeneity of discussion networks of three conspiracy theories (Hollow Earth, Chemtrails, and New World Order) on YouTube. A classification model was used to identify conspiracy and counter-conspiracy videos and associated user-generated comments (N = 123,642), as well as the interconnections between them. Although classification accuracy varied between the investigated conspiracy theories, our results indicated that people who expressed a favorable stance toward the conspiracy theory tended to respond to content or interact with users that shared the same opinion. In contrast, for two out of three conspiracy theories, people who advocated against the theory in their comments were more willing to engage in cross-cutting interactions. Findings are interpreted in light of the widely discussed fragmentation of homogeneous online networks. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1

During pandemic situations, myths, sensationalism, rumours and misinformation, generated intentionally or unintentionally, spread rapidly through social networks. Twitter is one of these popular social networks people use to share COVID-19 related news, information, and thoughts that reflect their perception and opinion about the pandemic. Evaluation of tweets for recognizing misinformation can create beneficial understanding to review the top quality and also the readability of online information concerning the COVID-19. This paper presents a multilingual COVID-19 related tweet analysis method, CMTA, that uses BERT, a deep learning model for multilingual tweet misinformation detection and classification. CMTA extracts features from multilingual textual data, which is then categorized into specific information classes. Classification is done by a Dense-CNN model trained on tweets manually annotated into information classes (i.e., 'false', 'partly false', 'misleading'). The paper presents an analysis of multilingual tweets from February to June, showing the distribution type of information spread across different languages. To access the performance of the CMTA multilingual model, we performed a comparative analysis of 8 monolingual model and CMTA for the misinformation detection task. The results show that our proposed CMTA model has surpassed various monolingual models which consolidated the fact that through transfer learning a multilingual framework could be developed.",0

Due to the implicit nature of conveying emotions in many scenarios, commonsense knowledge is widely utilized to enrich utterance semantics and enhance conversation modeling. However, most previous knowledge infusion methods perform empirical knowledge filtering and design highly customized architectures for knowledge interaction with the utterances, which can discard useful knowledge aspects and limit their generalizability to different knowledge sources. Based on these observations, we propose a Bipartite Heterogeneous Graph (BHG) method for enhancing emotional reasoning with commonsense knowledge. In BHG, the extracted context-aware utterance representations and knowledge representations are modeled as heterogeneous nodes. Two more knowledge aggregation node types are proposed to perform automatic knowledge filtering and interaction. BHG-based knowledge infusion can be directly generalized to multi-type and multi-grained knowledge sources. In addition, we propose a Multidimensional Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (MHGT) to perform graph reasoning, which can retain unchanged feature spaces and unequal dimensions for heterogeneous node types during inference to prevent unnecessary loss of information. Experiments show that BHG-based methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art knowledge infusion methods and show generalized knowledge infusion ability with higher efficiency. Further analysis proves that previous empirical knowledge filtering methods do not guarantee to provide the most useful knowledge information.

The limited resources problem requires efforts to build new and improved Arabic corpora and lexica. We propose a class-specific sentiment analysis (CLASENTI) framework. The framework includes a new annotation approach to build multi-faceted Arabic corpus and lexicon allowing for simultaneous annotation of different facets, including domains, dialects, linguistic issues, and polarity strengths. Each of these facets has multiple classes (e.g., the nine classes representing dialects found in the Arab world). The new corpus and lexicon annotations facilitate the development of new class-specific classification models and polarity strength calculation. For the new sentiment classification models, we propose a hybrid model combining corpus-based and lexicon-based models. The corpus-based model has two interrelated phases to build; (1) full-corpus classification models for all facets; and (2) class-specific models trained on filtered subsets of the corpus according to the performances of the full-corpus models. To calculate polarity strengths, the lexicon-based model filters the annotated lexicon based on the specific classes of the domain and dialect. As a case study, we collect and annotate 15274 reviews from various sources, including surveys, Facebook comments, and Twitter posts, pertaining to governmental services. In addition, we develop a new web-based application to apply the proposed framework on the case study.

Sentiment analysis has been used in several applications to identify the opinions of people, products, brands, services, etc., which can, for example, improve a company's business. Some of these applications claim to have more effective document representation models than merely Information Retrieval approaches like the bag-of-words representation. Document representation models have increased interest to solve some of the limitations that bag-of-words representation has. In this paper, the several sentiment analysis and document representation methods of Amazon reviews are compared. In this paper, traditional models such as a bag-of-words, bag-of-ngrams and their TF-IDF variants combined with linear classifiers such as Logistic Regression and SVM, and deep learning models such as word-based convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) and the simple long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network were used. Various document representation techniques such as Paragraph Vector or using pre-trained Word2Vec and Glove word embeddings to compute the vector for each word in the document were tested, and word vectors are aggregated using the element-wise mean. It is shown that deep learning models perform better on our large dataset than traditional models. LSTM resulted with the best accuracy of 95.55%. Deep learning models generally work better than traditional models as training set size increases. Our best performing model can be used for automatic sentiment classification for future product reviews in retail stores.",1

Hence, reliable methodologies are required for detecting the NAR tweets during a disaster. The existing works don't focus well on NAR tweets detection and also had poor performance. Hence, this paper focus on detection of NAR tweets during a disaster. Existing works often use features and appropriate machine learning algorithms on several Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Recently, there is a wide use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in text classification problems. However, it requires a large amount of manual labeled data. There is no such large labeled data is available for NAR tweets during a disaster. To overcome this problem, stacking of Convolutional Neural Networks with traditional feature based classifiers is proposed for detecting the NAR tweets. In our approach, we propose several informative features such as aid, need, food, packets, earthquake, etc. are used in the classifier and CNN. The learned features (output of CNN and classifier with informative features) are utilized in another classifier (meta-classifier) for detection of NAR tweets. The classifiers such as SVM, KNN, Decision tree, and Naive Bayes are used in the proposed model. From the experiments, we found that the usage of KNN (base classifier) and SVM (meta classifier) with the combination of CNN in the proposed model outperform the other algorithms.

"14053","Incorporating Background Checks with Sentiment Analysis to Identify Violence Risky Chinese Microblogs","Jia, Yun-Fei; Li, Shan; Wu, Renbiao",2019,"FUTURE INTERNET","Article","Based on Web 2.0 technology, more and more people tend to express their attitude or opinions on the Internet. Radical ideas, rumors, terrorism, or violent contents are also propagated on the Internet, causing several incidents of social panic every year in China. In fact, most of this content comprises joking or emotional catharsis. To detect this with conventional techniques usually incurs a large false alarm rate. To address this problem, this paper introduces a technique that combines sentiment analysis with background checks. State-of-the-art sentiment analysis usually depends on training datasets in a specific topic area. Unfortunately, for some domains, such as violence risk speech detection, there is no definitive training data. In particular, topic-independent sentiment analysis of short Chinese text has been rarely reported in the literature. In this paper, the violence risk of the Chinese microblogs is calculated from multiple perspectives. First, a lexicon-based method is used to retrieve violence-related microblogs, and then a similarity-based method is used to extract sentiment words. Semantic rules and emoticons are employed to obtain the sentiment polarity and sentiment strength of short texts. Second, the activity risk is calculated based on the characteristics of part of speech (PoS) sequence and by semantic rules, and then a threshold is set to capture the key users. Finally, the risk is confirmed by historical speeches and the opinions of the friend-circle of the key users. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the support vector machine (SVM) method on a topic-independent corpus and can effectively reduce the false alarm rate.",0

Currently, there exists no hard and fast modeling or classification over this for any society or global community. The marketing companies are currently relying on sentiment analysis for their products. In this paper social sentiment is focused on the form of collective sentiment and individual sentiment; we intend to classify these in the form of Macro and Micro-social sentiment. The sentiment varies among groups, sects etc. and various classes of society are depending on many other characteristics of the society. The social media is available to explore certain ideas, various trends, and their significance. The significance requires further exploration of more patterns and this cycle continues. The exploration cycle focuses on a research outcome. Based on above all the study focuses on the opinion classes towards the general think patterns. The Think Patterns (TP) are developed over time due to social traditions, fashions, family norms etc. The specific community think patterns are very difficult to classify like a female in restricted societies or rural societies of our country. Such trends and patterns are the focus of this study based on various defined parameters. The opinion and sentiment data analysis will be assessed using natural language processing (NLP) tools, Twitter, GATE, Google API's, etc.",1

Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from more than 27,000 m-library app users from 16 provinces and autonomous regions in China. Text analysis using latent Dirichlet allocation and Word2Vec was carried out by text preprocessing. Furthermore, a visual presentation was conducted through pyLDAvis and word cloud. Finally, combined with expert opinions, the results were summarized to find the different types of needs. Findings There are three different types of needs for improvement: needs of function, needs of technology and needs of experience. These types can be further divided into six subtypes: richness of function, feasibility of function, easiness of technology, stableness of technology, optimization of experience and customization of experience. Besides the richness of function, the feasibility of function has received the most attention from users. Originality/value Most studies on m-library user needs have only focused on a method of quantitative research based on questionnaire surveys. This study, however, is the first to apply text mining methods for large-scale user opinion texts, which place more focus on user needs and inspire libraries and app providers to further improve their services.",1

Opinions are shared openly and freely on social media and thus provide a rich source for trend analyses, which are accomplished by conventional methods of language interpretation, such as sentiment analysis. Due to its accuracy in studying unstructured data, deep learning has been increasingly used to test opinions. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a promising approach in textual analysis and exhibit large morphological variations. In total, 193 studies used RNNs in English-language sentiment analysis, and 24 studies used RNNs in Arabic-language sentiment analysis. Those studies varied in the areas they address, the functionality and weaknesses of the models, and the number and scale of the available datasets for different dialects. Such variations are worthy of attention and monitoring; thus, this paper presents a systematic examination of the literature to label, evaluate, and identify state-of-the-art studies using RNNs for Arabic sentiment analysis.",0

Qualitative research captures the perspectives of health professionals as end-users of PROMs and can be used to inform adoption efforts. This paper presents a systematic review and synthesis of qualitative research conducted to address the question: What are the attitudes of health professionals towards PROMs in oncology, including any barriers and facilitators to the adoption of PROMS, reported in qualitative evidence?MethodsSystematic searches of qualitative evidence were undertaken in four databases and reviewed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies published in English between 1998 and 2018, which reported qualitative findings about the attitudes of health professionals working in oncology towards PROMs were eligible. Studies were assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme's Qualitative Research Checklist. A sentiment analysis was conducted on primary text to examine the polarity (neutral, positive or negative) of health professionals' views of PROMs. Qualitative meta-synthesis was conducted using a constant comparative analysis.ResultsFrom 1227 articles after duplicates were removed, with 1014 excluded against the screening criteria, 213 full text articles remained and were assessed; 34 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included. The majority of studies were of good quality. Sentiment analysis on primary text demonstrated an overall positive polarity from the expressed opinions of health professionals. The meta-synthesis showed health professionals' attitudes in four domains: identifying patient issues and needs using PROMs; managing and addressing patient issues; the care experience; and the integration of PROMs into clinical practice.ConclusionsFrom the accounts of health professionals, the fit of PROMs with existing practice, how PROMs are valued, capacity to respond to PROMs and the supports in place, formed the key factors which may impede or promote adoption of PROMs in routine practice. To assist policy-makers and services involved in implementing these initiatives, further evidence is required about the relationship between PROMs data collection and corresponding clinical actions.Trial registrationInternational Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) CRD42019119447, 6th March, 2019.",0

It accommodates people to share an opinion and spread the news from society using the hashtag to make trending. During this Covid-19 pandemic period, the Indonesian government formulated an Enforcement of Community Activity Restrictions policy to control the spread. However, Indonesian post their opinion and concern through Twitter about the policies. There always be pros and cons to government policies. There is a need to cluster this data into neutral, negative sentiment, or positive sentiment. Clustering helps the government to know Indonesian society's reaction. Positive tweets will support the policies, while negative tweets will evaluate the policies. This study aims to be a reference that displays public sentiment about government policy. In this research, we acquire Twitter data from July sixth, 2021, then pre-process the text, classify the sentence into its sentiment, and visualize the data into word cloud and graph. The data processing uses the Python programming language. Textblob is used to analyze tweets based on subjectivity and polarity. The results show that majority of tweets are neutral, about 52.7%.

Covid-19 first appeared in Indonesia on March 2, 2020, with two confirmed cases and increased to 1285 cases in 30 provinces. One of the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic is on the economic aspect, which has experienced a drastic decline in income. This study aims to classify public opinion to determine the level of public sentiment on the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and to identify parameters that influence the accuracy of the sentiment analysis classification model. The methods used in this current research are Lexicon, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC). First, Lexicon is used for scoring and labeling the preprocessed data. Second, SVM is used to classify the sentiment, then find the best accuracy using linear, radial, polynomial, and sigmoid kernels. Third, NBC is used to classify sentiment as a comparison method. The results indicated that 255 tweet data consisted of 44 positive tweets (17.25%), 46 neutral tweets (18.04%), and 165 negative tweets (64.71%). Therefore, it can be inferred that the economic impact on the Indonesian people due to the Covid-19 pandemic has a high negative sentiment value. In the performance, SVM yielded a better accuracy of 100%, precision, recall, and F-measure are 1. This study proves that selecting the kernel type and applying underfitting can improve the accuracy of SVM. Also, SVM can perform well on a small amount of training data. © 2023, Politeknik Negeri Padang. All rights reserved.",1
"17091","Influential Factors on Collective Anxiety of Online Topic-Based Communities","Yang, Yi; Ta, Na; Li, Kaiyu; Jiao, Fang; Hu, Baijing; Li, Zhanghao",2021,"FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY","Article","Background: Under the uncertainty led by the decentralized information on social media, people seek homogeneity in either opinions or affection to establish group identity to better understand the information. This also means they are easily polarized, not only ideologically but also in their actions. Affective polarization is the emotional tendency for people to show animosity toward opposing partisans while seeking homogeneity from fellow partisans. Much research into online affective polarization has focused on quantifying anxiety at an individual level while neglecting that on a collective basis. Therefore, this paper examined the polarization of collective anxiety in topic-based communities on Weibo. Methods: We aim to interpret correlations between collective anxiety online and topic characteristics, user competence, as well as the proportion of influencers of Weibo topic-based communities. Our neural networks model and statistical analysis were based on 200 communities with 403,380 personal accounts and 1,012,830 messages. Results: Collective anxiety levels are correlated to (1) the extent to which a topic captures public interest, (2) how community members articulate topics on social network platforms, and (3) the ratio of influencers in the community. Specifically, people's conflicting perceptions and articulations of topics might increase collective anxiety, while the extent to which a topic is of the public interest and the number of influencers engaged in a topic account for any decline in its ranking. Furthermore, familiarity with a topic does not help predict collective anxiety levels. There are no significant links between community size or interactivity dynamics and the level of collective anxiety in the topic-based community. Our computational model has 85.00% precision and 87.00% recall. Conclusion: This study found the collective anxiety augment due to topic proximities to public interest and members' lack of declarative knowledge on topics, while to decline with an increasing portion of online influencers. These findings indicate that collective anxiety is induced due to a lack of credibility. Also, the amount of conflicting information shared by different people places them in a state of flux. Therefore, a community with more influencers may be more likely to experience anxiety polarization, bringing forth the issue of layered information and inequality.",0

People use various social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, for sharing their ideas, opinions, and feelings. Users of different age groups, cultures, education backgrounds manipulate these powerful mediums of communication. Even though it gives all the benefits of knowledge sharing among the users, it has a dark side too. Despite setting restrictions from the corresponding sites, many users use abusive language to blemish the status and image of someone. So it is highly the need of the hour for the government or the particular social media platform to sift out those unwanted hate texts before diffusing them. Finding the hate text is one of the emerging research topics in Natural Language Processing where the model predicts the given text as hate text or not. This automated hate text detection becomes tedious when we consider the Indian languages due to a lack of data. Moreover, Indian people are multilingual and use code-mixed patterns to express their thoughts. The unavailability of the annotated Tamil-English dataset and the lack of a standard model make this task more challenging. In our paper, to handle such code-mixed data, a dataset is created with 10000 Tamil-English code-mixed texts collected from Twitter. These are annotated as hate text/non-hate text. In this paper, we use a synonym-based Bi-LSTM model for classifying hate non-hate text in tweets.",0

The effective fusion of multiple modalities (e.g., text, acoustic, or visual frames) is a non-trivial task, as these modalities, often, carry distinct and diverse information, and do not contribute equally. The issue further escalates when these data contain noise. In this article, we study the concept of multi-task learning for multi-modal affect analysis and explore a contextual inter-modal attention framework that aims to leverage the association among the neighboring utterances and their multi-modal information. In general, sentiments and emotions have inter-dependence on each other (e.g., anger. negative or happy. positive). In our current work, we exploit the relatedness among the participating tasks in the multi-task framework. We define three different multi-task setups, each having two tasks, i.e., sentiment & emotion classification, sentiment classification & sentiment intensity prediction, and emotion classification & emotion intensity prediction. Our evaluation of the proposed system on the CMU-Multi-modal Opinion Sentiment and Emotion Intensity benchmark dataset suggests that, in comparison with the single-task learning framework, our multi-task framework yields better performance for the inter-related participating tasks.

(57226715290)",2023,"Public Health","Article","Objectives: Mpox has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization on July 23, 2022. Since early May 2022, Mpox has been continuously reported in several endemic countries with alarming death rates. This led to several discussions and deliberations on the Mpox virus among the general public through social media and platforms such as health forums. This study proposes natural language processing techniques such as topic modeling to unearth the general public's perspectives and sentiments on growing Mpox cases worldwide. Study design: This was a detailed qualitative study using natural language processing on the user-generated comments from social media. Methods: A detailed analysis using topic modeling and sentiment analysis on Reddit comments (n = 289,073) that were posted between June 1 and August 5, 2022, was conducted. While the topic modeling was used to infer major themes related to the health emergency and user concerns, the sentiment analysis was conducted to see how the general public responded to different aspects of the outbreak. Results: The results revealed several interesting and useful themes, such as Mpox symptoms, Mpox transmission, international travel, government interventions, and homophobia from the user-generated contents. The results further confirm that there are many stigmas and fear of the unknown nature of the Mpox virus, which is prevalent in almost all topics and themes unearthed. Conclusions: Analyzing public discourse and sentiments toward health emergencies and disease outbreaks is highly important. The insights that could be leveraged from the user-generated comments from public forums such as social media may be important for community health intervention programs and infodemiology researchers. The findings from this study effectively analyzed the public perceptions that may enable quantifying the effectiveness of measures imposed by governmental administrations.

Recent research has shown that deep learning models, i.e., Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Transformer-based provide promising results for recognizing sentiment. Nonetheless, CNN has the advantage of extracting high-level features by using convolutional and max-pooling layers; it cannot efficiently learn a sequence of correlations. At the same time, Bidirectional RNN uses two RNN directions to improve extracting long-term dependencies. However, it cannot extract local features in parallel, and Transformer-based like Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) are the computational resources needed to fine-tune, facing an overfitting problem on small datasets. This paper proposes a novel attention-based model that utilizes CNNs with LSTM (named ACL-SA). First, it applies a preprocessor to enhance the data quality and employ term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) feature weighting and pre-trained Glove word embedding approaches to extract meaningful information from textual data. In addition, it utilizes CNN's max-pooling to extract contextual features and reduce feature dimensionality. Moreover, it uses an integrated bidirectional LSTM to capture long-term dependencies. Furthermore, it applies the attention mechanism at the CNN's output layer to emphasize each word's attention level. To avoid overfitting, the Guasiannoise and GuasianDroupout are adopted as regularization. The model's robustness is evaluated on four English standard datasets, i.e., Sentiment140, US-airline, Sentiment140-MV, SA4A with various performance matrices, and compared efficiency with existing baseline models and approaches.

This has resulted in a great hotbed for the growth of rumors, as anyone can spread knowledge and opinions without confirmation. Previous works on rumor detection focused on hand-extracted features and spent less effort on text representation. In this research, a novel method for rumor detection on social media is proposed, which integrates entity recognition, sentence reconfiguration and ordinary differential equation network under a unified framework called ESODE. An entity recognition method to enhance the semantic understanding of rumor texts is used. Then, a sentence reconfiguration to improve the frequency of important words is designed. The complete feature map is established by further collecting statistical features from three aspects: linguistic features on the content of rumors, characteristics of users involved in rumor propagating, and propagation network structures. Finally, the ordinary differential equation network (ODEnet) is applied to detect rumors. Experimental results on datasets from Twitter and Weibo show that the proposed method achieves better performance than previous ones. (C)& nbsp;2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.",0

This information can be used to make decisions about future products and services, marketing campaigns or customer service issues. Using artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning, natural language processing and sentiment analysis, it will be possible to create and implement systems that can analyze consumer opinions and feedback on e-commerce platforms. In this context, the objective of this paper is to compare supervised machine learning models based on their performance metrics in order to define the best performing model for consumer sentiment analysis, using a dataset that concerns a women's clothing e-commerce store and focuses on the comments written by customers on their different products. © Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan (ZUJ).",1

These community services are typically used through different applications including personal computers, multiple applications of modern smartphones and wearable technologies. Proper identification and separation of different languages text, topic-based classification of text and classification of active users based on their published comments and posts are major challenges. In this research, our primary focus is to deal with English text collected through different IoT applications to analyse posts/comments to categorise people's opinion in politics. We have developed an IoT framework model for collecting data from social media especially Facebook, preprocessed and clean data to be used for analysis, and separation of data based on different languages. Sentiment analysis techniques are used to detect polarisation of the individual user. The proposed system clustered IoT individuals based on their comments and posts and successfully detected political polarisation. The proposed approach obtained encouraging results with a precision of 66.7%, a recall of 71.4%, and an F-measure of 69.0% in the case of annotated data of 50 users and a precision of 75.0%, a recall of 87.1%, and F-measure of 80.6% in the case of annotated data of 100 users.",1

As for objectives like business decision making and public opinion analysis, how to make the best of these precious opinionated words is a new challenge in the field of NLP. The field of opinion mining, or sentiment analysis, has become active in recent years. Since different kinds of deep neural networks differ in their structures, they are probably extracting different features. We investigated whether features generated by heterogeneous deep neural networks can be combined by multi-view learning to improve the overall performance. With document level opinion mining being the objective, we implemented multi-view learning based on heterogeneous deep neural networks. Experiments show that multi-view learning utilizing these heterogeneous features outperforms single-view deep neural networks. Our framework makes better use of single-view data.",1

"14260","A Generic Approach for Wheat Disease Classification and Verification Using Expert Opinion for Knowledge-Based Decisions","Haider, Waleej; Rehman, Aqeel-Ur; Durrani, Nouman M.; Rehman, Sadiq Ur",2021,"IEEE ACCESS","Article","Crop diseases have mainly affected crop production due to the lack of modern approaches for disease identification. For many years, farmers have identified various crop diseases and have local knowledge about disease management. However, the local knowledge of one agricultural region is not utilized in other regions due to the unavailability of knowledge sharing platforms. Agricultural research also suggests that crop production has mainly decreased due to diseases, methods of cultivation, irrigation, and lack of local agricultural knowledge. In this research, the experience of agricultural experts, farmers, and cultivators is gathered through a crowd-sourced platform. The data is then processed for various disease identification. Hence, timely identification of various crop diseases can benefit farmers to apply relevant management methods. In literature, researchers have proposed various methods for disease management, mostly based on the classification of crop diseases using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. However, these algorithms are unable to give trustful results due to static data provisioning and the dynamic nature of various diseases in different agricultural regions. Further, the agricultural expert's experience is also not considered in verifying the classification results. To identify the dynamic nature of wheat diseases, we acquired high-quality images and symptoms-based text data from farmers, domain experts, and users using a crowd-sourced platform. Different augmentation techniques were also used to enhance the size of training data. In this paper, a modern generic approach has been proposed for the identification and classification of wheat diseases using Decision Trees (DT) and different deep learning models. Also, results of both algorithms were then verified by domain experts that improved the decision trees accuracy by 28.5%, CNN accuracy by 4.3% (leading to 97.2%), and resulted in decision rules for wheat diseases in a knowledge-based system.",0

P.",2020,"INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND DATA SCIENCE","Proceedings Paper","The dramatic increase in the number of users on social media platform leads to the generation of huge amount of unstructured text in the form of messages, chats, posts and blogs. Besides the exchange of information, social media is a remarkably convenient medium to express the ideas and opinions which gain popularity when liked by a large set of users. This popularity may reflect the sentiment of people towards that person, organization or a place. The social media platform, such as Twitter, generates huge amounts of the text containing political insights, which can be mined to analyze the people's opinion and predict the future trends in the elections. In this work, an attempt is made to the mine tweets, capture the political sentiments from it and model it as a supervised learning problem. The extraction of tweets pertaining to the General Elections of India in 2019 is carried out along with the study of sentiments among Twitter users towards the major national political parties participating in the electoral process. Subsequently, the classification model based on sentiments is prepared to predict the inclination of tweets to infer the results of the elections. The Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is employed to prepare the classification model and compare it with the classical machine learning models. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",1

Though those opinions are too many to be examined one by one, this is why a general reputation value will help people make a decision toward a target entity (purchase, download, rent horizontal ellipsis ). This fact makes reputation generation task very challenging because an inaccurate reputation system will directly damage the credibility and popularity of the target entity. This paper aims to improve a recent work that handles the task of generating reputation based on fuzing and mining opinions expressed in natural languages and user feedback ratings. Therefore, we have proposed a hybrid approach that, (i) separates reviews into positive and negative based on their sentiment polarity by applying the two classifiers Naive Bayes and Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM), (ii) groups positive and negative reviews into principal opinion sets based on their semantic relations, (iii) calculates a custom reputation value separately for positive and negative groups by considering some statistics of principal opinion sets and finally (iv) computes the final reputation value using Weighted Arithmetic Mean. Experimental results show a significant improvement with respect to recent work.",1

Recently, it plays a requisite role in sentiment analysis or opinion mining. However, emotion vocabulary has not received considerable attention in second or foreign language learning. The insufficient pedagogical materials and inefficient tool support seem to provide little help for learners to master emotion words. The current study considers the application of sentiment analysis to language learning. To achieve this goal, we developed RESOLVE, a context-aware emotion synonym suggestion system, for educational purposes. Utilizing machine-learning techniques, the system is capable of suggesting synonymous emotion words appropriate to learners' contexts. Importantly, the usage information of each emotion word, including scenario descriptions, definitions, and example sentences, is provided in order to help develop language learners' vocabulary knowledge as well as help facilitate their word use. A pedagogical evaluation of the system's effectiveness was conducted using a writing task and a survey questionnaire. The results indicate that the participants achieved substantial progress on emotion word use with the help of the proposed system. In particular, less proficient participants demonstrated greater improvements. Meanwhile, participants showed positive attitudes toward the tool support, as it helps them to have a better command of emotion words in their writings.",0

Therefore, can customer sentiments expressed in social media influence electronic word of mouth (e-WOM)? This research identifies customer sentiments' influence on e-WOM and their differences based on brand personality. Brands have significantly different personalities; thus, we argue that sentiments (e.g., anger, anticipation, disgust, fear) that increase or decrease e-WOM also differ based on brand personality (sincerity, excitement, competence, sophistication, and ruggedness). Data from the top 100 most valuable global brands and more than 50,000 brand tweets were collected. We conducted a sentiment analysis on these tweets to identify customer sentiments. Then, computed regression analyses were performed, and a random forest model was constructed. This study consistently shows that the interaction terms between brand personality and sentiments are crucial to customer sentiments that increase or decrease e-WOM based on brand personality. For example, joy increases and decreases e-WOM of brands with an exciting personality and a competent and sophisticated personality, respectively. Furthermore, we conducted a cluster analysis to identify main brand clusters based on their personality and shed light on brand structure in the marketplace. We also discussed managerial implications and avenues for future research.",1

Secondly, we address the problem of performance evaluation of real-life mixtures, where the ground truth is not available. We bypass this issue by carefully designing a blind Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SI-SNR) neural estimator. Through a user study, we show that our estimator reliably evaluates the separation performance on real mixtures, i.e. we observe that the performance predictions of the SI-SNR estimator correlate well with human opinions. Moreover, when evaluating popular speech separation models, we observe that the performance trends predicted by our estimator on the REAL-M dataset closely follow the performance trends achieved on synthetic benchmarks.",0

It can primarily be carried out at three levels: document, sentence, and aspect level. Work proposed is an effort to rate a product and predict its demand based on features extracted from aspects of opinion expressed with fuzzy set decision boundary. Aspect identification, aspect-based opinion word identification, and inclination as positive, negative or neutral are the three major tasks in aspect-based opinion mining. Weights were assigned according to the polarity percentage of the words extracted. Polarity scores of the labeled dataset were then divided into 5 fuzzy set decision boundaries, confirmed positive, positive, neutral, negative, and confirmed negative, to accurately predict the correlation between polarity score obtained and product rating. Algorithm proposed was operated on aspect-based corpus for product rating which acquired from GitHub, comprised of 7563 rows of product aspects; the analysis suggests that maximum share 44% lies with positive range of fuzzy boundary, and this can be tapped for trend prediction of customer choice; the algorithm successfully provides a fuzzy-assisted prediction mechanism for product rating for the corpus with labeled aspects; algorithm performs at par with existing technique, and it also provides percentage share of products presence in market for future trends. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",1

People usually use social media, especially Twitter, to transfer knowledge and beliefs on global concerns like COVID-19-vaccination, hence, Twitter is a good source for investigating public opinions. The present study aimed to assess Persian tweets to (1) analyze Iranian people's view toward COVID-19 vaccination. (2) Compare Iranian views toward a homegrown and imported COVID-19-vaccines. Methods: First, a total of 803278 Persian tweets were retrieved from Twitter, mentioning COVIran Barekat (the homegrown vaccine), Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca/Oxford, Moderna, and Sinopharm (imported vaccines) between April 1, 2021 and September 30, 2021. Then, we identified sentiments of retrieved tweets using a deep learning sentiment analysis model based on CNN-LSTM architecture. Finally, we investigated Iranian views toward COVID-19-vaccination. Results: (1) We found a subtle difference in the number of positive sentiments toward the homegrown and foreign vaccines, and the latter had the dominant positive polarity. (2) The negative sentiment regarding homegrown and imported vaccines seems to be increasing in some months. (3) We also observed no significant differences between the percentage of overall positive and negative opinions toward vaccination amongst Iranian people. Conclusions: It is worrisome that the negative sentiment toward homegrown and imported vaccines increases in Iran in some months. Since public healthcare agencies aim to increase the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines to end the pandemic, they can focus on social media such as Twitter to promote positive messaging and decrease opposing views.

Whereas, the main problem is to analyze the qualitative feedback based on comments, while performing these analysis manually need a lot of effort and time. In this research paper, we developed and suggest an automatic solution for extracting implicit aspects and comments analyzing. The problem of implicit aspect extraction and sentiments analysis is solved by splitting the sentence through defined boundaries and extracting each sentence into a form of isolated list. Moreover, these isolated list elements are also known as complete sentence. As sentences are further separated into words, these words are filtered to remove anonymous words in which words are saved in words list for the aspects matching; this technique is used to measure polarity and sentiments analysis.",0

A computational analysis approach","Ivonchyk, Mikhail; Moldogaziev, Tima T.",2022,"URBAN GEOGRAPHY","Article","Financialization of urban governance is a process taking place with varying degrees of depth around the world. A key intermediary and a product that many cities must face to gain access to capital are credit rating firms and their opinions of underlying credit quality. Given the required economies of scale and scope with information intermediation, three global firms have emerged to offer methodologies for fundamental components of subnational government risk, which they claim follows a standardized credit assessment schedule. Computational text analysis offers insights about a crucial credit quality assessment mechanism as well as the potential convergence in management foci of city credit quality assessments globally. Specifically, the findings will assist in unpacking the management factors of city credit quality, with implications for both cities and investors in an increasingly financialized environment of urban governance.",0

As attention is primarily focused on student misuse of the technology, the potential affordances of generative AI tools may often be overlooked. In this paper we highlight potential affordances of AI generative tools, such as ChatGPT, for creating language learning and teaching materials and assessments. We offer suggestions on crafting prompts as well as provide example prompts and the materials and assessments generated by ChatGPT in response. We also present a framework for evaluation that combines both of Hubbard’s (1988) framework for CALL evaluation and The Douglas Fir Group’s (2016) transdisciplinary framework that may assist language educators in determining when it is appropriate to leverage generative AI tools. We then briefly illustrate how the framework has been used in our own evaluations. Finally, we suggest language educators consider how the concerns and opinions of using AI-based tools held by individuals and institutions within their own micro, meso, and macro sociocultural levels align or conflict with those of the individuals and institutions of their students’ micro, meso, and macro sociocultural levels. © 2023, Teaching English with Technology.

Remarkable success has been achieved when sufficient labeled training data is available. However, annotating sufficient data is labor-intensive, which establishes significant barriers for generalizing the stance classifier to the data with new targets. In this paper, we proposed a Semantic-Emotion Knowledge Transferring (SEKT) model for cross-target stance detection, which uses the external knowledge (semantic and emotion lexicons) as a bridge to enable knowledge transfer across different targets. Specifically, a semantic-emotion heterogeneous graph is constructed from external semantic and emotion lexicons, which is then fed into a graph convolutional network to learn multi-hop semantic connections between words and emotion tags. Then, the learned semantic-emotion graph representation, which serves as prior knowledge bridging the gap between the source and target domains, is fully integrated into the bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) stance classifier by adding a novel knowledge-aware memory unit to the BiLSTM cell. Extensive experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate the superiority of SEKT against the state-of-the-art baseline methods.",1

Those sources of information can be used to build a predictive system capable of processing sentiments expressed in suicidal notes to detect and predict suicidal tendencies before committing the act of suicide. In this work, we are interested in building a predicting system based on different approaches of deep learning models capable of processing suicidal note written in Arabic language. Despite the fact that the Arabic language is one of the languages that are widely spoken and written, both in real life and through social media, it is noticeable that there is a significant lack in terms of sentiment analysis and opinion mining systems dedicated to this language. In this paper, we have established a particular process to predict if the writer of a given note has more likely suicide tendencies or not. We can recap this process in five steps: first step is a pretreatment step; it is based on Arabic light-stemming algorithms. The second step concern data augmentation. The third step has a double goal; features extraction and features representation. The fourth step concern the building of the predictive algorithm; two deep learning models are used: CNN and LSTM. The fifth and final step is a validation step; in which we can determine the best model.",0

On the other hand, opinion mining in social media is nowadays an important parameter of social media marketing. Digital media giants such as Google and Facebook developed and employed their own tools for that purpose. These tools are based on publicly available software libraries and tools such as Word2Vec (or Doc2Vec) and fasttext, which emphasize topic modeling and extract low-level features using deep learning approaches. So far, researchers have focused their efforts on opinion mining and especially on sentiment analysis of tweets. This trend reflects the availability of the Twitter API that simplifies automatic data (tweet) collection and testing of the proposed algorithms in real situations. However, if we are really interested in realistic opinion mining we should consider mining opinions from social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, which are far more popular among everyday people. The basic purpose of this paper is to compare various kinds of low-level features, including those extracted through deep learning, as in fasttext and Doc2Vec, and keywords suggested by the crowd, called crowd lexicon herein, through a crowdsourcing platform. The application target is sentiment analysis of tweets and Facebook comments on commercial products. We also compare several machine learning methods for the creation of sentiment analysis models and conclude that, even in the era of big data, allowing people to annotate (a small portion of) data would allow effective artificial intelligence tools to be developed using the learning by example paradigm.",1

We believe that compiling, organizing, exploring, and analyzing data from social media platforms, such as Twitter, can offer various perspectives to public health organizations and decision makers in identifying factors that contribute to vaccine hesitancy. In this study, public tweets were downloaded daily from Tweeter using the Tweeter API. Before performing computation, the tweets were preprocessed and labeled. Vocabulary normalization was based on stemming and lemmatization. The NRCLexicon technique was deployed to convert the tweets into ten classes: positive sentiment, negative sentiment, and eight basic emotions (joy, trust, fear, surprise, anticipation, anger, disgust, and sadness). t-test was used to check the statistical significance of the relationships among the basic emotions. Our analysis shows that the p-values of joy–sadness, trust–disgust, fear–anger, surprise–anticipation, and negative–positive relations are close to zero. Finally, neural network architectures, including 1DCNN, LSTM, Multiple-Layer Perceptron, and BERT, were trained and tested in a COVID-19 multi-classification of sentiments and emotions (positive, negative, joy, sadness, trust, disgust, fear, anger, surprise, and anticipation).

As it tends to happen with verbal communication, people express their opinions in written form and through an analysis of their words, one can extract what an individual wants from a product, a topic, or an event. By looking at the emotions expressed in such content, governments, businesses, and people can learn a lot that can help them improve their strategies. Therefore, in this study, we will use different algorithms to improve the Moroccan sentiment classification. The first step is to gather and prepare Moroccan Dialectal Arabic Twitter comments. Then, a lot of different combinations of extraction (n-grams) and weighting schemes (BOW/ TF-IDF) and word embedding for feature construction are applied to get the best classification models. We used Naive Bayes, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic regression and LSTM to classify the data we prepared. Our machine learning approach, which incorporates sentiment analysis, was designed to analyze Twitter comments written in Modern Standard Arabic or Moroccan Dialectal Arabic. As a final benchmark of our paper, we were simply a sliver shy away from the 70% mark in our accuracy by relying on the SVM algorithm. Although not a game-changing result, this was enough to encourage us to continue developing our model further.",0

Sentiment scores seemingly represent an objective means of assessing the mood of social media users, consumers, and the public at large. Similar to other computational tools, sentiment analysis promises to reduce complexity and mitigate information overload, and to inform the decisions of marketers, pollsters, and scholars with reliable data. This article argues that the assumptions encoded into sentiment analysis as a method are accompanied by a number of constraints, both regarding its technical limitations (in terms of what sentiment analysis can and cannot accomplish) and conceptually (in terms of what the notion of sentiment implicitly represents), constraints which are often de-emphasized in public discourse. After providing an overview of its history and development in computer science as well as psychology and the social sciences, we turn to the role of sentiment as a currency in the attention economy. We then present a brief study of common framing of sentiment analysis in the news media, highlighting the expectations that exist regarding its analytical capabilities.

Recent studies employ text generation models to accomplish this task. However, there are still two problems, how to effectively reduce the ASQP task’s high complexity, and the possibility that the generative model may predict explicit terms that do not exist in text sentences. In order to fill the gap, this paper proposes a novel text generation model Cartesian-ASQP based on the Transformer architecture. Specifically, this paper simplifies the aspect-based sentiment quad prediction task to a sentiment triple extraction task by performing a Cartesian product operation on the aspect categories and sentiment polarity sets. For sentiment quadruplet text sentences containing pronouns as implicit terms, we present an implicit term processing strategy by semantically mapping these terms back to pronouns. On the output side, for the situation when the explicit aspect/opinion words predicted by the model are absent from input sentences, this paper introduces a two-stage term correction strategy to solve the problem. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms various baseline methods and achieves outperform performance. This work also validates that our proposed model can effectively handle the task of aspect-based sentiment quad prediction with a large number of implicit aspect and opinion terms. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",1

This data may appear in different forms like streaming text, images, audio, videos, etc. In this paper, we address the problem of deciding the appropriateness of streaming videos with the help of on-demand crowdsourcing. We propose a novel crowd-powered model ViSSa, which is an open crowdsourcing platform that helps to automatically detect appropriateness of the videos getting uploaded online through employing the viewers of existing videos. The proposed model presents a unique approach of not only identifying unsafe videos but also detecting the portion of inappropriateness (in terms of platform's vulnerabilities). Our experiments with 47 crowd contributors demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. On the designed ViSSa platform, 18 safe videos are initially posted. After getting access, 20 new videos are added by different users. These videos are assessed (and marked as safe or unsafe) by users and finally with judgment analysis a consensus judgment is obtained. The approach detects the unsafe videos with high accuracy (95%) and point out the portion of inappropriateness. Interestingly, changing the mode of video segment allocation (homogeneous and heterogeneous) is found to have a significant impact on the viewers' feedback. However, the proposed approach performs consistently well in different modes of viewing (with varying diversity of opinions), and with any arbitrary video size and type. The users are found to be motivated by their sense of responsibility. This paper also highlights the importance of identifying spammers through such models.",0

One main challenge of this task is to correlate relevant opinion words with aspect terms, especially for the aspect terms consisting multi words. To this end, attention mechanism plays an important role in previous models due to its capability of modeling the relationship between the context and aspect words, and solving the defect of parallelization which can't be realized in conventional neural network like recurrent neural network. However, the attention mechanism may introduce irrelevant noise and reduce models’ performance. To alleviate the above problem, graph neural network is proposed which utilize the syntactic information for ABSA task. Following this line, we propose a semantic enhancement graph attention network model named SEN-GAT, which innovatively introduce the aggregation and aspect-aware attention mechanism. The experimental results on standard datasets show that our proposed model can substantially improve ABSA tasks performance. © 2023 SPIE.",1

Then, the obtained results are fed into a Feedforward Neural Network. The Soft Mapping layer consisting of stacking Soft Attention module is finally used to map the results to a higher dimension to realize the fusion of multimodal information. The proposed model can fully consider the relationship between multiple modal pieces of information and provides a new solution to the problem of data interaction in multimodal sentiment analysis.

Since ASTE consists of multiple subtasks, including opinion entity extraction, relation detection, and sentiment classification, it is critical and challenging to appropriately capture and utilize the associations among them. In this paper, we transform ASTE task into a multi-turn machine reading comprehension (MTMRC) task and propose a bidirectional MRC (BMRC) framework to address this challenge. Specifically, we devise three types of queries, including non-restrictive extraction queries, restrictive extraction queries and sentiment classification queries, to build the associations among different subtasks. Furthermore, considering that an aspect sentiment triplet can derive from either an aspect or an opinion expression, we design a bidirectional MRC structure. One direction sequentially recognizes aspects, opinion expressions, and sentiments to obtain triplets, while the other direction identifies opinion expressions first, then aspects, and at last sentiments. By making the two directions complement each other, our framework can identify triplets more comprehensively. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that BMRC achieves state-of-the-art performances.",1

Existing research on emotion analysis has focused mostly on detecting types of emotions, and has solved problems using classification-based methods. Recently, fine-grained emotion analysis has attracted the attention of researchers for probing the essential elements of emotions, such as the causes, experiencers and results of emotion events, which could help further elucidate textual emotions in more depth. In this paper, we focus on the task of emotion cause extraction, aiming to recognize the causes in sentences that provoke certain emotions. We propose a two stage supervised ranking method for accurately extracting the emotion causes based on information retrieval techniques. In the first stage, we measure the complexity of provoked emotions using query performance predictors to distinguish the number of causes for each emotion in contexts. In the second stage, we incorporate the emotion complexity into learning an autoencoder-enhanced ranking model for accurately extracting the causal clauses. We also extract abundant emotion-level clause features for clause representations as the learning samples. We evaluate the proposed method on an existing dataset for emotion cause extraction and demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods. The proposed method is effective in extracting textual emotion causes in sentences, which can greatly benefit in-depth emotion analysis for effective cognitive computing. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, a group of automated actors known as social bots have been found to coexist with human users in discussions regarding the coronavirus crisis, which may pose threats to public health. To figure out how these actors distorted public opinion and sentiment expressions in the outbreak, this study selected three critical timepoints in the development of the pandemic and conducted a topic-based sentiment analysis for bot-generated and human-generated tweets. The findings show that suspected social bots contributed to as much as 9.27% of COVID-19 discussions on Twitter. Social bots and humans shared a similar trend on sentiment polarity-positive or negative-for almost all topics. For the most negative topics, social bots were even more negative than humans. Their sentiment expressions were weaker than those of humans for most topics, except for COVID-19 in the US and the healthcare system. In most cases, social bots were more likely to actively amplify humans' emotions, rather than to trigger humans' amplification. In discussions of COVID-19 in the US, social bots managed to trigger bot-to-human anger transmission. Although these automated accounts expressed more sadness towards health risks, they failed to pass sadness to humans.",1

However, less than 6% of Tweets are Geo-tagged, which limits the implementation of those applications. There are two groups of solutions: content and network-based. The first group uses location indicative factors like URLs and topics, extracted from the content of tweets, to infer Geo-location for non geoactive users, whereas the second group benefits from friendship ties in the underlying social network graph. Friendship ties are better predictors compared to content information because they are less noisy and often follow the natural human spatial movement patterns. However, their prediction's accuracy is still limited because they ignore the temporal aspects of human behavior and always assume a single location per user. This research aims to extend the current network-based approaches by taking users' temporal dimension into account. We assume multiple locations per user during different time-slots and hypothesize that location predictability varies depending on the time and the properties of the social membership group. Thus, we propose a hierarchical solution to apply temporal categorizations on top of social network partitioning for multiple location prediction for users in Online Social Networks (OSNs) like Twitter. Given a largescale Twitter dataset, we show that users' location predictability exhibits different behavior in different time-slots and different social groups. We find that there are specific conditions where users are more predictable in terms of Geo-location. Our solution outperforms the state-of-the-art by improving the prediction accuracy by 16:6% in terms of Median Error Distance (MED) over the same recall.",0

We argue that affective polarization is influenced by exposure to one of the most dominant ways to cover politics: strategy coverage. While previous studies have pointed to the negative consequences of covering politicians' strategies and campaign tactics, we find that this reporting style decreases out-party hostility. Our findings are based on two separate studies: (1) a survey experiment and (2) a cross-sectional analysis that increases external validity by combining survey data with computational content analysis of the articles respondents were exposed to by their primary news sources throughout the 2016 US presidential campaign (415,604 articles from 157 American news outlets).

The dataset had already been annotated continuously in two affective dimensions related to the emotions: Valence and Arousal. We annotated the part of SEMAINE called Solid SAL composed of 79 interactions between a user and an operator playing the role of a virtual agent designed to engage a person in a sustained, emotionally colored conversation. We aligned the audio at the word level using the available high-quality manual transcriptions. The annotated dataset contains 5627 speech turns for a total of 73,944 words, corresponding to 6 hours 20 minutes of dyadic interactions. Each interaction has been labeled by three annotators at the speech turn level following a three-step process. This method allows us to obtain a precise annotation regarding the opinion of a speaker. We obtain thus a dataset dense in opinions, with more than 48% of the annotated speech turns containing at least one opinion. We then propose a new baseline for the detection of opinions in interactions improving slightly a state of the art model with RoBERTa embeddings.

This enables organizations to gain insights directly from customers' opinions for better decision making. This work presents a new methodology for evaluating an organisation's product-positioning strategy through eWOM analytics. A product's mispositioning has significant negative effects and there is strong interest in identifying ways to avoid it. Current methods that utilize eWOM for product positioning evaluation mostly use post-product release reviews and do not statistically evaluate the effect of time on the product positioning; nor do they provide any means to diagnose the cause of mispositioning. The temporal aspect of positioning, however, provides valuable insights into which product features are more time-invariant and accordingly makes it possible to plan for product redesign or repositioning to maximize profitability. A case study is presented in the context of smartphones using design science research, utilizing Twitter data regarding the release of a new product, collected using a custom Android application. The research questions addressed in this paper are: (1) How do consumers' preferences change over time with regards to the product's positioning? (2) Which product features positively influence product positioning and which negatively? To answer these questions, we compared the product-positioning strategy and consumers' opinions before and after the release of a new product to identify possible discrepancies between expected and actual positioning of the product. This work constitutes a methodological contribution with demonstrated implications for new product positioning strategy evaluation using tweet analysis.",0

Moreover, we explore the idea that opinion-based news articles cannot be classified as real or fake due to their subjective nature and often sensationalised language, and propose a novel two-step classification pipeline to remove such articles from both model training and the final deployed inference system. Experiments over the ISOT and Combined Corpus datasets show that transformers achieve an increase in F-1 scores of up to 4.9% for out of distribution generalisation compared to baseline approaches, with a further increase of 10.1% following the implementation of our two-step classification pipeline.

Security Crises, Rivalries, and Polarization in American Foreign Policy","Myrick, Rachel",2021,"INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION","Article","A common explanation for the increasing polarization in contemporary American foreign policy is the absence of external threat. I identify two mechanisms through which threats could reduce polarization: by revealing information about an adversary that elicits a bipartisan response from policymakers (information mechanism) and by heightening the salience of national relative to partisan identity (identity mechanism). To evaluate the information mechanism, study 1 uses computational text analysis of congressional speeches to explore whether security threats reduce partisanship in attitudes toward foreign adversaries. To evaluate the identity mechanism, study 2 uses public opinion polls to assess whether threats reduce affective polarization among the public. Study 3 tests both mechanisms in a survey experiment that heightens a security threat from China. I find that the external threat hypothesis has limited ability to explain either polarization in US foreign policy or affective polarization among the American public. Instead, responses to external threats reflect the domestic political environment in which they are introduced. The findings cast doubt on predictions that new foreign threats will inherently create partisan unity.",1

In many cases, people want to quickly identify those most informative posts, which contain details, insights or in-depth criticisms, to help them make better decisions. To meet this demand, a three-stage model is proposed. First, a super-network model is introduced to accommodate the multidimensional attributes of online posts, including keywords, user ID, emotions and the related event. Second, a corpus updating mechanism is introduced to generate event specific corpora, which help to discriminate the informative quality of posts in the next stage. Third, machine learning algorithms are applied, where the posts are first filtered by a linear discriminant classifier and then assessed by a multilayer perceptron neural network. To test the model, we chose six online public opinion events that fell into two categories: major public safety crisis and online controversies about public policies. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of the proposed model, where majority of errors are less than 0.05, on a 0-1 measuring scale. In the future, this model may also be adapted to areas including evaluation of informative quality of websites, product reviews and answers in question and answer communities. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study seeks to develop a framework comprising of three operators, namely Assemble+Deft, Edify+Authenticate and Forecast to classify opinion instances as sarcastic or non-sarcastic. The framework is tested with a Twitter dataset using key state-of-the-art techniques, namely Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Gated recurrent unit and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The dataset consists of opinions on effect of COVID-19 pandemic on air travel. The evaluation metrics used include precision, accuracy, recall and F1-score. The experimental analysis showed a significant increase from 9.28% under a standard sentiment review to 10.1% optimized sentiment analysis. The findings further show a significant improvement in the performance of optimized SVM yielding an improved prediction performance compared to RNN. The outcome of this study will support airlines to understand the frustration and complaints of customers and to make concrete decisions on how to improve their services. The framework will serve as a benchmark for future sentiment analysis in other sectors where customer views and comments are core to their services. © 2023 The Author(s)",0

Moreover, travel industry not only considered as the most dynamic sector but also the most importance generator of income and jobs in the country. Thus, the prototype for tourism plans are needed for strategic planning. Currently, social web is a great tool for providing useful insights about tourist behaviors especially with the text data that comes from travelers' opinions. In this work, we use sequential patterns of users' behavior which are ordered by time from tourist including opinions, reviews as our input data. Then, we use Convolutional Long Short-Term Deep Learning (CLSTDL) which is a deep learning technique that combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the expected location. During the process, the output of CNN will be fed into LSTM to learn the sequence pattern behavior of traveler. The model output is then used to predict the next location that particular travelers are likely to go. The experimental results have shown that CLSTDL outperforms other models when evaluating with the accuracy and loss metrics.",0

This creates a huge stream of questions, that require highly qualified and well-educated individuals, called Muftis. With Muslims representing almost 25% of the planet population, and the scarcity of qualified Muftis, this creates a demand supply problem calling for Automation solutions. This motivates the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve this problem, which requires a well-designed Question-Answering (QA) system to solve it. In this work, we propose a QA system, based on retrieval augmented generative transformer model for jurisprudential legal question. The main idea in the proposed architecture is the leverage of both state-of-the art transformer models, and the existing knowledge base of legal sources and question-answers. With the sensitivity of the domain in mind, due to its importance in Muslims daily lives, our design balances between exploitation of knowledge bases, and exploration provided by the generative transformer models. We collect a custom data set of 850,000 entries, that includes the question, answer, and category of the question. Our evaluation methodology is based on both quantitative and qualitative methods. We use metrics like BERTScore and METEOR to evaluate the precision and recall of the system. We also provide many qualitative results that show the quality of the generated answers, and how relevant they are to the asked questions.",0

As a consequence, it became difficult for tourists to read all the comments to determine whether these opinions are positive or negative to assess the success of a tourism company. In this paper, a modest model is proposed to assess e-tourism companies using Iraqi dialect reviews collected from Facebook. The reviews are analyzed using text mining techniques for sentiment classification. The generated sentiment words are classified into positive, negative and neutral comments by utilizing Rough Set Theory, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor methods. After experimental results, it was determined that out of 71 tested Iraqi tourism companies, 28% from these companies have very good assessment, 26% from these companies have good assessment, 31% from these companies have medium assessment, 4% from these companies have acceptance assessment and 11% from these companies have bad assessment. These results helped the companies to improve their work and programs responding sufficiently and quickly to customer demands.",1

In polarized U.S. environmental politics, many Republicans attack the authority of scientists and regulators but some signal a desire for bipartisan policy compromises. Analyzing district characteristics and environmental communication on Twitter reveals that nominally pro-environment Republicans representing more moderate constituents fail to oppose their partisan colleagues, particularly during the Trump administration's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. At the same time, very few openly attacked climate science; instead, House Republicans primarily focused attention on fossil fuels, the Environmental Protection Agency and the right of the federal government to regulate economic activity. The 'Waters of the United States' served as a rallying cry for opposition to environmental regulation in the 115(th)House of Representatives.",0

As an important step in public-opinion mining, stance detection has great potential for wide application and provides necessary data for decision-making by governments and enterprises. On social media, people exchange ideas by replies, in which the texts of replies are closely related to the context. Existing works in this regard focus mainly on the method of aggregating the context, but overlook the fact that the theme of texts alters with the progress of the response. Therefore, we propose a stance detection model that can effectively learn the thematic information, where contrastive learning is used to enhance the learning effect of thematic information. Experiments were performed on CreateDebate and Kialo datasets, and our proposed model achieved an accuracy of 68.0% and 69.6% on the two datasets, respectively.

"16501","R-Transformer Network Based on Position and Self-Attention Mechanism for Aspect-Level Sentiment Classification","Zhou, Ziyu; Liu, Fang'ai; Wang, Qianqian",2019,"IEEE ACCESS","Article","Aspect-level sentiment classification (ASC) is a research hotspot in natural language processing, which aims to infer the sentiment polarity of a particular aspect in an opinion sentence. There are three main influence factors in the aspect-level sentiment classification: the semantic information of the context; the interaction information of the context and aspect; the position information between the aspect and the context. Some researchers have proposed way to solve aspect-level sentiment classification. However, previous work mainly used the average vector of the aspect to calculate the attention score of the context, which introduced the influence of noise words. Moreover, these attention-based approaches simply used relative positions to calculate positional information for contextual and aspect terms and did not provided better semantic information. Based on these above questions, in this paper, we propose the PSRTN model. Firstly, obtaining the position-aware influence propagate between words and aspects by Gaussian kernel and generating the influence vector for each context word. Secondly, capturing global and local information of the context by the R-Transformer, and using the self-attention mechanism to obtain the keywords in the aspect. Finally, context representation of a particular aspect is generated for classification. In order to evaluate the validity of the model, we conduct experiments on SemEval2014 and Twitter. The results show that the accuracy of the PSRTN model can reach 83.8%, 80.9%, and 75.1% on three data sets, respectively.",1

Analysis of such material where more than one person is involved has a spate challenge as compared to other text analysis tasks. There are several approaches to identify users' emotions from the conversational text for the English language, however regional or low resource languages have been neglected. The Urdu language is one of them and despite being used by millions of users across the globe, with the best of our knowledge there exists no work on dialogue analysis in the Urdu language. Therefore, in this paper, we have proposed a model which utilizes deep learning and machine learning approaches for the classification of users' emotions from the text. To accomplish this task, we have first created a dataset for the Urdu language with the help of existing English language datasets for dialogue analysis. After that, we have preprocessed the data and selected dialogues with common emotions. Once the dataset is prepared, we have used different deep learning and machine learning techniques for the classification of emotion. We have tuned the algorithms according to the Urdu language datasets. The experimental evaluation has shown encouraging results with 67% accuracy for the Urdu dialogue datasets, more than 10, 000 dialogues are classified into five emotions i.e., joy, fear, anger, sadness, and neutral. We believe that this is the first effort for emotion detection from the conversational text in the Urdu language domain.",0

We collected a total of 263 posts and 1,832 comments on the subject of ‘AI interview’ and classified them into the emotional expressions and intentions of posts. The results revealed that the majority of the posts expressed negative emotions rather than positive ones. The negative emotions were expressed mostly toward self or the AI interviewer, the hiring company, or the AI interview solution company. Furthermore, posts and comments not revealing emotions were requesting or sharing information. It is also found that posts expressing negative emotions were likely to receive supportive comments whereas informative posts were likely to garner sneering comments.

"14497","Identifying signs of syntactic complexity for rule-based sentence simplification","Evans, Richard; Orasan, Constantin",2019,"NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING","Article","This article presents a new method to automatically simplify English sentences. The approach is designed to reduce the number of compound clauses and nominally bound relative clauses in input sentences. The article provides an overview of a corpus annotated with information about various explicit signs of syntactic complexity and describes the two major components of a sentence simplification method that works by exploiting information on the signs occurring in the sentences of a text. The first component is a sign tagger which automatically classifies signs in accordance with the annotation scheme used to annotate the corpus. The second component is an iterative rule-based sentence transformation tool. Exploiting the sign tagger in conjunction with other NLP components, the sentence transformation tool automatically rewrites long sentences containing compound clauses and nominally bound relative clauses as sequences of shorter single-clause sentences. Evaluation of the different components reveals acceptable performance in rewriting sentences containing compound clauses but less accuracy when rewriting sentences containing nominally bound relative clauses. A detailed error analysis revealed that the major sources of error include inaccurate sign tagging, the relatively limited coverage of the rules used to rewrite sentences, and an inability to discriminate between various subtypes of clause coordination. Despite this, the system performed well in comparison with two baselines. This finding was reinforced by automatic estimations of the readability of system output and by surveys of readers' opinions about the accuracy, accessibility, and meaning of this output.",0

It helps firms track brand sentiment to determine whether customers have favorable or unfavorable feelings about their goods and services. Revolutions are happening in social media, as many companies are adopting innovative tools, technologies, and products for various applications. Analyzing these tools and providing opinions on them is considered a best practice that is being followed all over the world. Expressing sentiments in the English language is universal, yet providing sentiments in a regional language could be of great help to people who are well versed in their languages. Researchers are paying more attention to various regional languages in India. Analyzing sentiments in regional languages is a complex task as it requires a standard corpus. Telugu is a regional language with a wealth of data readily available on social media, but finding class labels of sentences for Telugu Sentiment Analysis is difficult. The objective of this work is to devise a framework based on the supervised learning principle. The work has been done by constructing the corpus named """"SentiKanna,"""" which comprises multiple domains such as recipes, tourism, and movies written in Telugu script. The SentiKanna corpus contains a collection of Telugu sentences extracted from various sources and manually annotated according to our annotation guidelines.

"11793","Aspect-based sentiment analysis of reviews in the domain of higher education","Nikolic, Nikola; Grljevic, Olivera; Kovacevic, Aleksandar",2020,"ELECTRONIC LIBRARY","Article","Purpose Student recruitment and retention are important issues for all higher education institutions. Constant monitoring of student satisfaction levels is therefore crucial. Traditionally, students voice their opinions through official surveys organized by the universities. In addition to that, nowadays, social media and review websites such as Rate my professors are rich sources of opinions that should not be ignored. Automated mining of students' opinions can be realized via aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). ABSA s is a sub-discipline of natural language processing (NLP) that focusses on the identification of sentiments (negative, neutral, positive) and aspects (sentiment targets) in a sentence. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a system for ABSA of free text reviews expressed in student opinion surveys in the Serbian language. Sentiment analysis was carried out at the finest level of text granularity - the level of sentence segment (phrase and clause). Design/methodology/approach The presented system relies on NLP techniques, machine learning models, rules and dictionaries. The corpora collected and annotated for system development and evaluation comprise students' reviews of teaching staff at the Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad, Serbia, and a corpus of publicly available reviews from the Serbian equivalent of the Rate my professors website. Findings The research results indicate that positive sentiment can successfully be identified with the F-measure of 0.83, while negative sentiment can be detected with the F-measure of 0.94. While the F-measure for the aspect's range is between 0.49 and 0.89, depending on their frequency in the corpus. Furthermore, the authors have concluded that the quality of ABSA depends on the source of the reviews (official students' surveys vs review websites). Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study of ABSA carried out at the level of sentence segment for the Serbian language. The methodology and findings presented in this paper provide a much-needed bases for further work on sentiment analysis for the Serbian language that is well under-resourced and under-researched in this area.",1

The presence of various aspects discussed in user reviews makes it even harder to accurately extract and classify the sentiments. Aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to extract and classify user's positive or negative orientation towards each aspect. Although several aspect-based sentiment classification methods have been proposed in the past, limited work has been targeted towards the automatic extraction of implicit, infrequent and co-referential aspects. Moreover, existing methods lack the ability to accurately classify the overall polarity of multi-aspect sentiments. This study aims to develop a predictive framework for aspect-based extraction and classification. The proposed framework utilises the semantic relations among review phrases to extract implicit and infrequent aspects for accurate sentiment predictions.

It is worth analyzing as wide an area as possible to obtain the full impression of a specific enterprise. News website content is a datum source that expresses the public's opinion on enterprise operations, status, etc. Therefore, it is worth analyzing the news portal article text. Sentiment analysis in English texts and financial area texts exist, and are accurate, the complexity of Lithuanian language is mostly concentrated on sentiment analysis of comment texts, and does not provide high accuracy. Therefore in this paper, the supervised machine learning model was implemented to assign sentiment analysis on financial context news, gathered from Lithuanian language websites. The analysis was made using three commonly used classification algorithms in the field of sentiment analysis. The hyperparameters optimization using the grid search was performed to discover the best parameters of each classifier. All experimental investigations were made using the newly collected datasets from four Lithuanian news websites. The results of the applied machine learning algorithms show that the highest accuracy is obtained using a non-balanced dataset, via the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm (71.1%). The other algorithm accuracies were slightly lower: a long short-term memory (71%), and a support vector machine (70.4%).",1
"13895","Cross-Platform Reputation Generation System Based on Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis","Boumhidi, Achraf; Benlahbib, Abdessamad; Nfaoui, El Habib",2022,"IEEE ACCESS","Article","The active growth of Internet-based applications such as social networks and e-commerce websites leads people to generate a tremendous amount of opinions and reviews about products and services. Thus, it becomes very crucial to automatically process them. Over the last ten years, many systems have been proposed to generate and visualize reputation by mining textual and numerical reviews. However, they have neglected the fact that online reviews could be posted by malicious users that intend to affect the reputation of the target product. Besides, these systems provide an overall reputation value toward the entity and disregard generating reputation scores toward each aspect of the product. Therefore, we developed a system that incorporates spam filtering, review popularity, review posting time, and aspect-based sentiment analysis to generate accurate and reliable reputation values. The proposed model computes numerical reputation values for an entity and its aspects based on opinions collected from various platforms. Our proposed system also offers an advanced visualization tool that displays detailed information about its output. Experiment results conducted on multiple datasets collected from various platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Amazon ... ) show the efficacy of the proposed system compared with state-of-the-art reputation generation systems.",1

We collected and examined the flight reviews on TripAdvisor from January 2016 to August 2020 to gauge the impact of COVID-19 on passenger travel sentiment in several aspects. Till now, information systems, management, and tourism research have paid little attention to the use of deep learning and word embedding techniques, such as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, especially for aspect-level sentiment analysis. This paper aims to identify perceived aspect-based sentiments and predict unrated sentiments for various categories to address this research gap. Ultimately, this study complements existing sentiment analysis methods and extends the use of data-driven and visual analytics approaches to better understand customer satisfaction in the airline industry and within the context of the COVID-19. Our proposed method outperforms baseline comparisons and therefore contributes to the theoretical and managerial literature.",1

Jeberson Retna",2020,"ADCAIJ-ADVANCES IN DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE JOURNAL","Article","Data analytics and its associated applications have recently become important fields of study. The subject of concern for researchers now-a-days is a massive amount of data produced every minute and second as people constantly sharing thoughts, opinions about things that are associated with them. Social media info, however, is still unstructured, disseminated and hard to handle and need to be developed a strong foundation so that they can be utilized as valuable information on a particular topic. Processing such unstructured data in this area in terms of noise, co-relevance, emoticons, folksonomies and slangs is really quite challenging and therefore requires proper data pre-processing before getting the right sentiments. In this study we tried to study the impact of nine different pre-processing methods. Bag of Words (BOW), Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) features were selected and influence of pre-processing strategies were measured on the performance of ML classifiers with two real life dataset; one with domain and other not. We have evaluated five different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms viz Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT), Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). We have performed a comparative analysis of the success of these algorithms in order to decide which algorithm works best for the given dataset in terms of recall, accuracy, F1-score, precision, and Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC). It is demonstrated that SVM classifier outperformed the other classifiers with superior evaluations of 73.12% and 94.91% for accuracy and precision respectively. It is highlighted in this research that the selection and representation of features along with various pre-processing techniques have a positive impact on the performance of the classification. The ultimate outcome indicates an improvement in sentiment classification and we noted that pre-processing approaches obviously suggest an improvement in the efficiency of the classifiers.",0

Automatic sentiment extraction on a particular product can assist users in making buying decisions. For videos in languages such as Spanish, the tone of voice can be used to determine sentiments, since the translation is often unknown. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to classify sentiments in speech in the presence of environmental noise. Traditional models rely on pretrained audio feature extractors for humans that do not generalize well across different accents. In this paper, we leverage the vector space of emotional concepts where words with similar meanings often have the same prefix. For example, words starting with 'con' or 'ab' signify absence and hence negative sentiments. Augmentations are a popular way to amplify the training data during audio classification. However, some augmentations may result in a loss of accuracy. Hence, we propose a new metric based on eigenvalues to select the best augmentations. We evaluate the proposed approach on emotions in YouTube videos and outperform baselines in the range of 10-20%. Each neuron learns words with similar pronunciations and emotions. We also use the model to determine the presence of birds from audio recordings in the city.",0

(57209858562)",2023,"Journal of the American College of Radiology","Article","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to understand the public perception of CT colonography (CTC) in comparison with optical colonoscopy as a colorectal cancer screening technique. Methods: In this observational study, all English-language tweets from January 1, 2015, until September 1, 2021, containing terms related to CTC and terms related to optical colonoscopy were collected. The tweets were given sentiment scores using Twitter-roBERTa-base, a natural language processing model. These scores were then used to classify tweets into positive, neutral, and negative categories. The numbers of negative, positive, and neutral tweets were tabulated. Results: A total of 4,709 tweets from 2,194 users relating to CTC were collected. Of these tweets, 9.81% were negative, 68.52% were neutral, and 21.63% were positive. In comparison, a total of 445,969 tweets from 261,209 users were collected relating to optical colonoscopy. Of these tweets, 31.8% were negative, 51.3% were neutral, and 16.9% were positive. Conclusions: The public awareness of CTC remains limited in comparison with optical colonoscopy, with Twitter volume relating to CTC being about 1% the volume for optical colonoscopy. There was a higher proportion of negative tweets regarding colonoscopy. The lower proportion of negative tweets regarding CTC may be helpful in encouraging its use as an alternative to optical colonoscopy, with the aim of increasing uptake of colorectal cancer screening. © 2023 American College of Radiology",1

Was his choice of linguistic discourse a tool of popular control, response to public opinion, or both? Answering this question sheds light on the effectiveness of classical democratic conceptions of vertical accountability for populist leaders. Using a theoretical framework incorporating macro implications of Zaller's receive-accept-sample (RAS) model, the concept of Erikson, Mackuen, and Stimson's mood, and latent public opinion, we develop several competing expectations regarding rhetoric and presidential approval in Venezuela. Using computational sentiment analysis on a unique dataset of transcripts from Chavez's Alo Presidente broadcasts, we evaluate Chavez's quarterly public approval ratings with vector autoregression (VAR) and Koyck models. Results indicate presidential approval levels are causally linked to not only exogenous economic factors but also leader discourse. Results also indicate that leader language is not shaped by approval levels, illustrating the power of messaging and media control for populist leaders and the potential limits of democratic accountability.",0

Users' reviews express opinions and reflect implicit preferences and emotions towards the features of products or services. This paper proposes a model for the fine-grained analysis of emotions expressed in users' online written reviews, using film reviews on the Chinese social networking site Douban.com as an example. The model extracts feature-sentiment word pairs in user reviews according to four syntactic dependencies, examines film features, and scores the sentiment values of film features according to user preferences. User group personalized recommendations are realized through user clustering and user similarity calculation. Experiments show that the extraction of user feature-sentiment word pairs based on four syntactic dependencies can better identify the implicit preferences of users, apply them to recommendations and thereby increase recommendation accuracy.",1

There are two possibilities either people will gain money, or he will be going to lose his entire savings. So for safe side stock market prediction is required, which is based on historical data. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid approach for stock market prediction using opinion mining and clustering method. A domain-specific approach has been used for which some stock with maximum capitalization has been taken for experiment. Among all the available approaches our proposed model is different alike existing methods it not only considers general states of mind and sentiments, but it also forms clusters of them using clustering algorithms. As an output of the model, it generates two types of output, one from the analysis of sentiment while another one from clustering-based by taking popular parameters of stock exchange into consideration. The final prediction is based on an examination of both the results. Also, for empirical analysis, we have considered stocks with maximum capitalization from 6 growing sectors of India like banking, oil, IT, pharma, automobile, and FMCG. As a result, we have observed that predicted values from the proposed approach show maximum similarity with the actual values of the stock.

Due to the proliferation of social media for instance Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and others, sentiment analysis and opinion mining grow rapidly. It branches out from the field of natural language processing and data mining particularly from web mining and text mining. Why sentiment analysis and also known as opinion mining is prevalent and relevant nowadays? When we try to decide to purchase a product, we are likely to get the opinions from friends or relatives and do some surveys before we purchase the product. Hence, opinions are undeniably the key influencer of our behavior as well as the central to nearly all of the activities. Within the opinions, we often find the neutral, positive and negative polarities in the sentences. Based on the sentiment analysis taxonomy, it has opinion mining to have the opinion polarity classification, subjectivity detection, opinion spam detection, opinion summarization and argument expression detection. On the other hand, emotion mining has the emotion polarity classification, emotion detection, emotion cause detection and emotion classification.

Sudheep; Santhanakrishnan, T.",2021,"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & DECISION MAKING","Article","Analyzing and gathering the people's reactions on product trading, public services, etc. are crucial. Sentiment analysis (also termed as opinion mining) is a usual dialogue preparing act that plans on discovering the sentiments after opinions in texts on changing subjects. This research work adopts a novel sentiment analysis approach that comprises six phases like (i) Pre-processing, (ii) Keyword extraction and its sentiment categorization, (iii) Semantic word extraction, (iv) Semantic similarity checking, (v) Feature extraction, and (vi) Classification. Accordingly, the Mongodb documented tweets initially underwent pre-processing with stop word removal, stemming, and blank space removal. Regarding the extracted keywords, the existing semantic words are derived after categorizing the sentiment of keywords. Additionally, the semantic similarity score is evaluated along with their keywords. The subsequent step is feature extraction, where the Holoentropy features such as cross Holoentropy and joint Holoentropy are formulated. Along with this, the extraction of weighted holoentropy features is the major work, where weight is multiplied with the holoentropy features. Moreover, in order to enhance the performance of classification results, the constant term utilized in evaluating the weight function is optimized. For this optimal tuning, a new, improved algorithm termed as Self Adaptive Moth Flame Optimization (SA-MFO) is introduced, which is the adaptive version of MFO algorithm. For classification, this paper aims to use the Deep Convolutional Neural network (DCNN), where the batch size is fine-tuned using the same SA-MFO algorithm.

Textual data contributes a major share towards data generated on the world wide web. Understanding people's sentiment is an important aspect of natural language processing, but this opinion can be biased and incorrect, if people use sarcasm while commenting, posting status updates or reviewing any product or a movie. Thus, it is of utmost importance to detect sarcasm correctly and make a correct prediction about the people's intentions. Design/methodology/approach: This study tries to evaluate various machine learning models along with standard and hybrid deep learning models across various standardized datasets. We have performed vectorization of text using word embedding techniques. This has been done to convert the textual data into vectors for analytical purposes. We have used three standardized datasets available in public domain and used three word embeddings i.e Word2Vec, GloVe and fastText to validate the hypothesis. Findings: The results were analyzed and conclusions are drawn. The key finding is: the hybrid models that include Bidirectional LongTerm Short Memory (Bi-LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) outperform others conventional machine learning as well as deep learning models across all the datasets considered in this study, making our hypothesis valid. Research limitations: Using the data from different sources and customizing the models according to each dataset, slightly decreases the usability of the technique. But, overall this methodology provides effective measures to identify the presence of sarcasm with a minimum average accuracy of 80% or above for one dataset and better than the current baseline results for the other datasets. Practical implications: The results provide solid insights for the system developers to integrate this model into real-time analysis of any review or comment posted in the public domain. This study has various other practical implications for businesses that depend on user ratings and public opinions. This study also provides a launching platform for various researchers to work on the problem of sarcasm identification in textual data. Originality/value: This is a first of its kind study, to provide us the difference between conventional and the hybrid methods of prediction of sarcasm in textual data. The study also provides possible indicators that hybrid models are better when applied to textual data for analysis of sarcasm.",0

Sentiment analysis as a way to automatically detect and categorize people's opinions in text, needs to reflect this diversity and individuality. One possible approach to analyze such traits is to take a person's past opinions into consideration. In practice, such a model can suffer from the data sparsity issue, thus it is difficult to develop. In this article, we take texts from social platforms and propose a preliminary model for evaluating the effectiveness of including user information from the past, and offer a solution for the data sparsity. Furthermore, we present a finer-designed, enhanced model that focuses on frequent users and offers to capture the decay of past opinions using various gaps between the creation time of the text. An attention-based Hawkes process on top of a recurrent neural network is applied for this purpose, and the performance of the model is evaluated with Twitter data. With the proposed framework, positive results are shown which opens up new perspectives for future research.",1

At the same time, the ubiquitous social media results in abundant social relations such as following and follower relations. Social relations create a new source for microblog sentiment analysis, which attracts a great amount of attention in recent years. There are two theories that support the use of social relations for sentiment analysis - sentiment consistency and emotional contagion. However, most existing microblog sentiment analysis methods only employ direct connections which cannot fully use the heterogeneous connections in social media. As online social networks consist of communities and nodes in the same community which form weak dependency connections usually share similarities, we investigate how to exploit weak dependency connections as an aspect of social contexts for microblog sentiment analysis in this paper. In particular, we employ community detection methods to capture weak dependency connections and propose a new model for microblog sentiment analysis which incorporates weak dependency connections, sentiment consistency, and emotional contagion together with text information. Experimental results on two real Twitter datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can outperform baseline methods consistently and significantly. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0

Previous approaches to ASTE usually simultaneously extract all three components or first identify the aspect and opinion terms, then pair them up to predict their sentiment polarities. In this work, we present a novel paradigm, ASTE-RL, by regarding the aspect and opinion terms as arguments of the expressed sentiment in a hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) framework. We first focus on sentiments expressed in a sentence, then identify the target aspect and opinion terms for that sentiment. This takes into account the mutual interactions among the triplet's components while improving exploration and sample efficiency. Furthermore, this hierarchical RL setup enables us to deal with multiple and overlapping triplets. In our experiments, we evaluate our model on existing datasets from laptop and restaurant domains and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

"12089","Hidden Bias in Empirical Textualism","Jennejohn, Matthew; Nelson, Samuel; Nunez, D. Carolina",2021,"GEORGETOWN LAW JOURNAL","Article","A new interpretive technique called corpus linguistics has exploded in use over the past five years from state supreme courts and federal courts of appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court. Corpus linguistics involves searching a large database, or corpus, of text to identify patterns in the way in which a certain term is used in context. Proponents of the method argue that it is a more empirical approach than referencing dictionaries to determine a word's public meaning, which is a touchstone in originalist approaches to legal interpretation. This Article identifies an important concern about the use of corpus linguistics in legal interpretation that courts and scholarship have overlooked: bias. Using new machine learning techniques that analyze bias in text, this Article provides empirical evidence that the thousands of documents in the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA), the leading corpus currently used in judicial opinions, reflect gender bias. Courts and scholars have not considered that the COHA is sexist, raising the possibility that corpus linguistics methods could serve as a vehicle for infecting judicial opinions with longstanding prejudices in U.S. society. In addition to raising this important new problem, this Article charts a course for dealing with it. It explains how hidden biases can be made transparent and introduces steps for debiasing corpora used in legal interpretation. More broadly, it shows how the methods introduced here can be used to study biases in all areas of the law, raising the prospect of a revolution in our understanding of how discriminatory biases affect legal decisionmaking.",0

Detecting fake news is a daunting challenge due to subtle difference between real and fake news. As a first step of fighting with fake news, this paper characterizes hundreds of popular fake and real news measured by shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook from two perspectives: Web sites and content. Our site analysis reveals that the Web sites of the fake and real news publishers exhibit diverse registration behaviors and registration timing. In addition, fake news tends to disappear from theWeb after a certain amount of time. The content characterizations on the fake and real news corpus suggest that simply applying term frequency - inverse document frequency (tf-idf) and Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling is inefficient in detecting fake news, while exploring document similarity with the term and word vectors is a very promising direction for predicting fake and real news. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to systematically study the Web sites and content characteristics of fake and real news, which will provide key insights for effectively detecting fake news on social media.",0

Detecting potential causes of user emotion in online contents is beneficial to public opinion monitoring, government decision-making, and other security-related applications. Existing studies treat this task as a binary clause-level classification problem, which considers each clause separately and omits the context information of clauses. Moreover, previous work only models emotion-dependent linguistic representations of clauses but ignores emotion-independent features in clauses including cause indicators. To address the above two issues, we formalize this task as a sequence labeling problem and propose the COntext-aware Multi-View attention networks (COMV) for emotion cause extraction. Our proposed model integrates context information and learns multi-view clause representations. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.",0

S.; Patil, Nagamma",2018,"PROGRESS IN INTELLIGENT COMPUTING TECHNIQUES: THEORY, PRACTICE, AND APPLICATIONS, VOL 2","Proceedings Paper","Blogs are textual web documents published by bloggers to share their experience or opinion about a particular topic(s). These blogs are frequently retrieved by the readers who are in need of such information. Existing techniques for text mining and web document mining can be applied to blogs to ease the blog retrieval. But these existing techniques consider only the content of the blogs or tags associated with them for mining topics from these blogs. This paper proposes a Multidimensional Approach to Blog Mining which defines a method to combine the Blog Content and Blog Tags to obtain Blog Patterns. These Blog Patterns represent a blog better when compared to Blog Content Patterns or Blog Tag Patterns. These Blog Patterns can either be used for Blog Clustering or used by Blog Retrieval Engines to compare with user queries.

Media is a crucial tool to shape public opinion, and is used heavily by the power elite to bring legitimacy to their policy decisions. In this paper, we empirically analyze the coverage given to the power elite in mainstream media on Demonetization, a significant, recent policy event in India. We compare the extent of coverage given to the elite and non-elite, the policy slant expressed by them, and differences in coverage between seven of the largest news media organizations in India. We find that among the power elite, powerful politicians and political parties are given the maximum coverage in the media, with conspicuous negligence in coverage given to expert opinions. Sentiment analysis clearly reveals that opposing political factions express opposing views towards the policy, and there is variation across different news sources as well. We are applying our methods on other contentious policy events to be able to do a more systematic analysis of how media can aid the power elite to shape public opinion by giving them disproportionately large coverage and visibility.",1

These epistemic problems are connected to social media and they raise a classic problem of how to understand the role of technology in political developments. We discuss three sets of technological affordances of social media that facilitate the spread of false beliefs: obscuring the provenance of information, facilitating deception about authorship, and providing for manipulation of social signals. We argue that these do not make social media a cause of problems with falsehoods, but explanations of epistemic problems should account for social media to understand the timing and widespread occurrence of epistemic problems. We argue that the marketplace of ideas cannot be adequate as a remedy for these problems, which require epistemic editing by the press.",0

It has become a tool for spreading the news, discussing ideas and comments on world events. Twitter is also an important source of health-related information, given the amount of news, opinions and information that is shared by both citizens and official sources. It is a challenge identifying interesting and useful content from large text-streams in different languages, few works have explored languages other than English. In this paper, we use topic identification and sentiment analysis to explore a large number of tweets in both countries with a high number of spreading and deaths by COVID-19, Brazil, and the USA. We employ 3,332,565 tweets in English and 3,155,277 tweets in Portuguese to compare and discuss the effectiveness of topic identification and sentiment analysis in both languages. We ranked ten topics and analyzed the content discussed on Twitter for four months providing an assessment of the discourse evolution over time. The topics we identified were representative of the news outlets during April and August in both countries. We contribute to the study of the Portuguese language, to the analysis of sentiment trends over a long period and their relation to announced news, and the comparison of the human behavior in two different geographical locations affected by this pandemic. It is important to understand public reactions, information dissemination and consensus building in all major forms, including social media in different countries. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Despite its huge amount, standard supervised learning methods won't work upon such sort of data due to lack of labels and the impracticality of (human) labeling at this scale. In this work, we leverage distant supervision and semi-supervised learning to annotate a big stream of tweets from 2015 which consists of 228 million tweets without retweets (and 275 million with retweets). We present the insights from our annotation process regarding the effect of different semi-supervised learning approaches, namely Self-Learning, Co-Training and Expectation-Maximization. Moreover, we propose two annotation modes, the batch mode where all labeled and unlabeled data are available to the algorithms from the beginning and a lightweight streaming mode that processes the data in batches based on their arrival time in the stream. Our experiments show that stream processing with a sliding window of three months achieves comparable results to batch processing while being more efficient. Finally, to tackle the class imbalance problem, as our dataset is imbalanced toward the positive sentiment class, and its aggravation by the semi-supervised learning methods, we employ data augmentation in the semi-supervised learning process in order to equalize the class distribution. Our results show that semi-supervised learning coupled with data augmentation outperforms significantly the default semi-supervised annotation process. We make the so-called TSentiment15 sentiment-annotated dataset available to the community to be used for evaluation purposes and for developing new methods.",0

These opinions are frequently manipulated by people who haven't been registered on the websites or who are paid by other organisations to create negative or misleading reviews about an item or brand. Spam reviews are generally fraudulent reviews, and they can have a significant impact on the digital marketplace's behaviour. With the growing need to convert such facts into usable evidence and knowledge, information retrieval and data mining have gotten a lot of attention. The modelling of documents into a clear and accurate set of characteristic single and numerous word phrases, which has an impact on overall actions and achievements, is predicted to be a key problem in natural language processing (NLP) known as feature extraction process. Quite a few kinds of features could be used to perform different tasks through various feature collection methods such as: Text categorization (Bag of words), Linguistic characteristics (LIWC), Genre Identification (POS tagging), Sentimental feature extraction, Term frequencies (TFIDF) and Word2Vec. For traditional classification tasks with smaller datasets, machine learning algorithms have produced the greatest results. Soft computing techniques, on the other hand, when optimised with larger datasets, provide a better solution for real-world scenario problems. This work is organised into several sections, each of which examines a distinct feature selection method, machine ensemble learning, and soft computing approaches in depth. Finally, the hybrid approach for detecting review spam is introduced. Copyright (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0

Sentiment analysis was employed by a number of companies to discover their customers’ mentalities and feelings regarding their products. Sentiment analysis is a technique for determining the intended meaning or polarity of tweets sent by Twitter users. As a result of the high volume of sentiment tweets, it is impossible to discern people’s overall perceptions without automatic sentiment analysis and classification. Numerous classifications of sentiment are emerging, with study concentrating on tweets. Five steps are used to analyse the sentiment data. The first phase is to collect data using the Twitter API, and the second step is to analyse and classify the dataset’s unique text data using natural language processing and text analytics. It’s a necessity because the dataset is so vast and includes so many slang terms and phrases. The second process is text preparation, which involves examining and extracting specific material as well as cleaning out non-textual components such as emoticons and numerical figures. Finally, sentiment analysis is performed on the extracted tweets, identifying emotion and inspecting the opinions. There is no objective communication, but individual expressions remain. Positive and negative sentiments are classified in the fourth phase of the algorithm. Sentiment analysis primary purpose is to turn unstructured text into useful information.

Finding the significant topics of a microblog is necessary for popularity tracing and public opinion following. This paper puts forward a method to detect topics from Chinese microblogs. Since traditional methods showed low performance on a short text from a microblog, we put forward a topic detection method based on the semantic description of the microblog post. The semantic expansion of the post supplies more information and clues for topic detection. First, semantic features are extracted from a microblog post. Second, the semantic features are expanded according to a thesaurus. Here TongYiCi CiLin is used as the lexical resource to find words with the same meaning. To overcome the polysemy problem, several semantic expansion strategies based on part-of-speech are introduced and compared. Third, an approach to detect topics based on semantic descriptions and an improved incremental clustering algorithm is introduced. A dataset from Sina Weibo is employed to evaluate our method. Experimental results show that our method can bring about better results both for post clustering and topic detection in Chinese microblogs. We also found that the semantic expansion of nouns is far more efficient than for other parts of speech. The potential mechanism of the phenomenon is also analyzed and discussed.",0

Sentiment analysis includes design of the system to search the user opinions in blog posts, comments, reviews or tweets regarding the product, policy or area. Many researchers carried out their research on opinion mining to identify the polarity of the statements. But the main problem during opinion mining is that the words chosen do not solve attribute relevancy and could not classify the positive and negative usage of uncertain terms. In order to address these problems, normal discriminant piecewise regressive (NDPR) sentiment classification technique is introduced. NDPR technique perform three processes, namely, pre-processing, feature extraction and classification to improve the accuracy level through forming classes (i.e., positive, neutral and negative) based on the extracted words from user review comments. Initially, NDPR technique performs the data pre-processing task for stemming and removing the stop words from review statements to reduce the file size that in turn improves the efficiency. After that, normal discriminant feature extraction process is carried out in NDPR technique to extract the opinion word from the review statements sent by reviewers. The related opinion words are systematized for their semantic equivalence of sentiment based on extracted word. This helps to reduce the time consumption to extract the opinions from reviewers. Finally, piecewise regressive sentiment classification (PRSC) process is carried out in NDPR technique to analyse the semantic opinion words for evaluating the sentiment class label. The sentiment class labels are categorized into positive, neutral and negative sentiments with the user review comments. This in turn helps to reduce the time consumption to extract the opinions from reviewers and to improve the review detection accuracy. The performance evaluation of NDPR technique is carried out with standard benchmark datasets of consumer product and services reviews extracted. The parameters used in evaluation are number of customer review words, accuracy, time complexity (TC) and false positive rate. Experimental analysis shows that NDPR technique reduces the time to extract the opinions from reviewers and false positive rate.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",1

This requires a comprehensive set of competencies. The objective of this scoping review was to identify, map, and systematize the literature on hospital manager competencies. The review involved six steps: (1) defining research questions; (2) identifying relevant literature; (3) selecting publications; (4) data extraction; (5) data analysis and result reporting; and (6) consultations. A total of 57 full-text publications were included (46 empirical studies, six literature reviews, four expert opinions/guidelines, and one dissertation). Interest in this topic has grown in recent years, with most of the identified studies published since 2015. The empirical studies fall into three major groups: 34.8% (16/46) examined hospital managers’ competencies in terms of their types or classifications; 30.4% (14/46) focused on their measurement; and 30.4% (14/46) examined both aspects. In majority of studies, both ‘hard competencies,’ such as specific technical knowledge or skills acquired through practical training, and ‘soft competencies,’ e.g., adaptability, leadership, communication, teamwork, are echoed for effective hospital management. These point out the importance of both ‘external’ formal education trainings as well as ‘internal’ peer-support and/or coaching as complementary competency improvement approaches. This scoping review helps build a knowledge base around the topic and provides implications for future research. The latter can involve: a targeted systematic review addressing the methods for measuring the level of competence of hospital managers or studies focused on identifying the need for new types of competencies.

We automatically classify and label search results on three topics (i.e., intellectual property rights, school uniforms, and atheism) as against, neutral, and in favor, and generate explanations for these labels. In a user study (N=203), we then investigate whether search result stance bias (balanced vs biased) and the level of explanation (plain text, label only, label and explanation) influence the diversity of search results clicked. We find that stance labels and explanations lead to a more diverse search result consumption. However, we do not find evidence for systematic opinion change among users in this context.

H.; Deshmukh, Sachin N.; Maashi, Mashael; Alharbi, Sadeen; Al-Baity, Heyam H.",2022,"COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE","Article","Most consumers depend on online reviews posted on e-commerce websites when determining whether or not to buy a service or a product. Moreover, due to the presence of fraudulent (deceptive) reviews, the fundamental problem in such reviews is not fully addressed. Thus, deceptive reviews present wrong and misguiding opinions that are harmful to consumers and e-commerce. People called fraudsters who intentionally write deceptive reviews to target and deceive potential consumers, as they target businesses that have a well-built reputation or fame for their personal promotion, create such reviews. Therefore, developing a deceptive review detection system is essential for identifying and classifying online product reviews as truthful or fake/deceptive reviews. The main objective of this research work is to analyze and identify online deceptive reviews in electronic product reviews in the Amazon and Yelp domains. For this purpose, two experiments were conducted individually. The first was executed on standard Yelp product reviews. The second was performed on Amazon product review datasets. For this dataset, we created and labeled it using a deceptiveness score calculated based on features extracted from the review text using the linguistic inquiry and word count (LIWC) tool. These features were authenticity, negative words, comparing words negation words, analytical thinking, and positive words as well as the given rating value by a user. The recurrent neural network, bidirectional long short-term memory (RNN-BLSTM) model, was used to both datasets in order to conduct the evaluation. The application of this model was contingent upon the learning of words embedding of the review text. Finally, we evaluated the RNN-BLSTM model's performance using the Yelp and Amazon datasets and compared the results. The results were 89.6% regarding testing accuracy for both datasets. From our experimental results, we observed that the LIWC feature with word embedding in the review text provided better accuracy performance compared with other existing methods.",0

Results from an analysis of Twitter data in Italy","Ajovalasit, Samantha; Dorgali, Veronica Maria; Mazza, Angelo; d'Onofrio, Alberto; Manfredi, Piero",2021,"PLOS ONE","Article","Background In Italy, in recent years, vaccination coverage for key immunizations as MMR has been declining to worryingly low levels, with large measles outbreaks. As a response in 2017, the Italian government expanded the number of mandatory immunizations introducing penalties to unvaccinated children's families. During the 2018 general elections campaign, immunization policy entered the political debate with the government in-charge blaming oppositions for fuelling vaccine scepticism. A new government (formerly in the opposition) established in 2018 temporarily relaxed penalties and announced the introduction of forms of flexibility. Objectives and methods First, we supplied a definition of disorientation, as the lack of well-established and resilient opinions among individuals, therefore causing them to change their positions as a consequence of sufficient external perturbations. Second, procedures for testing for the presence of both short and longer-term collective disorientation in Twitter signals were proposed. Third, a sentiment analysis on tweets posted in Italian during 2018 on immunization topics, and related polarity evaluations, were used to investigate whether the contrasting announcements at the highest political level might have originated disorientation amongst the Italian public. Results Vaccine-relevant tweeters' interactions peaked in response to main political events. Out of retained tweets, 70.0% resulted favourable to vaccination, 16.4% unfavourable, and 13.6% undecided, respectively. The smoothed time series of polarity proportions exhibit frequent large changes in the favourable proportion, superimposed to a clear up-and-down trend synchronized with the switch between governments in Spring 2018, suggesting evidence of disorientation among the public. Conclusions The reported evidence of disorientation for opinions expressed in online social media shows that critical health topics, such as vaccination, should never be used to achieve political consensus. This is worsened by the lack of a strong Italian institutional presence on Twitter, calling for efforts to contrast misinformation and the ensuing spread of hesitancy. It remains to be seen how this disorientation will impact future parents' vaccination decisions.",0

A majority of previous studies on these user-generated reviews are devoted to controversy, bias, and opinion analysis. However, little work has been done to study urban characteristics via topic analysis from the city level in reviews. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics system, to visually explore spatiotemporal urban topics for cultural trend discovery, location mining, and decision making. Specifying a topic by users is supported due to the difference between review text and traditional text, such as news and books, and the diversity of topics and users. Sentiment analysis and statistical analysis are adopted to characterize the temporal trend and sentiment and topic geographical distributions of the user-specific topic. Our system allows the user to interactively explore the time-evolving frequency trend and characteristic geographical distributions of a topic in reviews. We evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of our system using three case studies in different domains.",1

Such sentiments have shown an impact on many fields such as economics and politics. Different sentiment analysis approaches have been proposed in the literature to predict automatically sentiments shared in micro-blogs (e.g., tweets). A class of such approaches predicts opinion towards specific target (entity); this class is referred to as target-dependent sentiment classification. Another class, called open domain targeted sentiment classification, extracts targets from the micro-blog and predicts sentiment towards them. In this research work, we propose a new semi-supervised learning technique for developing open domain targeted sentiment classification by using fewer amounts of labelled data. To the best of our knowledge, our model represents the first semi-supervised technique that is proposed for open domain targeted sentiment classification. Additionally, we propose a new supervised learning model for improving accuracy of open domain targeted sentiment classification. Moreover, we show for the first time that SVM HMM is able to improve accuracy of open domain targeted sentiment classification. Experimental results show that our proposed technique outperforms other prominent techniques available in the literature.",1

In addition to the advancement of technology day by day, the pandemic, which has become a part of our lives since early 2020, has led to social media occupying a larger place in the lives of individuals. Therefore, social media posts have become an excellent data source for the field of sentiment analysis. The main contribution of this study is based on the Natural Language Processing method, which is one of the machine learning topics in the literature. Sentiment analysis classification is a solid example for machine learning tasks that belongs to human-machine interaction. It is essential to make the computer understand people emotional situation with classifiers. There are a limited number of Turkish language studies in the literature. Turkish language has different types of linguistic features from English. Since Turkish is an agglutinative language, it is challenging to make sentiment analysis with that language. This paper aims to perform sentiment analysis of several machine learning algorithms on Turkish language datasets that are collected from Twitter. In this research, besides using public dataset that belongs to Beyaz (2021) to get more general results, another dataset is created to understand the impact of the pandemic on people and to learn about public opinions. Therefore, a custom dataset, namely, SentimentSet (Balli 2021), was created, consisting of Turkish tweets that were filtered with words such as pandemic and corona by manually marking as positive, negative, or neutral. Besides, SentimentSet could be used in future researches as benchmark dataset. Results show classification accuracy of not only up to similar to 87% with test data from datasets of both datasets and trained models, but also up to similar to 84% with small Sample Test Data generated by the same methods as SentimentSet dataset. These research results contributed to indicating Turkish language specific sentiment analysis that is dependent on language specifications.",0

We performed sentiment analysis of more than one million reviews from 800 different Android apps collected by systematic scrapping of the Google Play Store. Identified apps were separated into five categories: AR, AR+Educational, VR, VR+Educational, and Educational. We identify reviews from each app as positive, negative, or neutral, and apply aspect labels depending on the content of the review. We adopted Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and classify the labels into seven categories: technical issues, usability, content, user interaction, feature request, learning qualities, and advert-related. The results indicate that the positive sentiments are 54.6% for AR, 49.6% for AR+Educational, 47.7% for VR, 71.4% for VR+Educational, and 75.2% for Educational. The results suggest that education apps that do not incorporate AR or VR are receiving higher user satisfaction than apps that incorporate these emerging technologies. Analyzing and understanding user reviews will help instructional designers, software developers, and hardware designers to resolve the key inhibitors .of these apps.",1

The problem of extracting users' preferences from a corpus of text can be solved by using traditional clustering algorithms, which work quite well when there is no predefined data structure. However, in this paper, we consider the problem of extracting users' preferences when they belong to a finite number of classes represented by the trip type. In this paper, we propose an encoding method based on a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), trained as a classifier for the classes that predefine data structure. The intuition behind convolutional neural encoding is its ability to maximize the distance between documents belonging to different classes in the new, derived feature space. Findings reveal that CNNs encoding has better discriminative properties than alternative encoding methods such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation or average word2vec encoding. Moreover, we demonstrate that CNNs encoding can be used to identify the unique topics associated with the predefined data structure determined, in this case, by the four trip types.",0

Manual approaches of detecting and analyzing such huge amount of posts are not feasible and there is a need for automated methods and techniques to discover the knowledge and patterns of the text content without human involvement. Text mining refers to the process of extracting interesting and significant patterns or knowledge from text documents. YouTube is known for its free provision of video sharing service. The content of YouTube videos may sometimes comprise of images or sequence(s) of images with unwanted material, such as aggression, which is the reason of emergence of many social problems, particularly among children such as demonstration of aggressive behavior and bullying at home, school and public places. The research work reports performance of machine learning classifiers that were applied on video transcripts of YouTube videos to detect aggression. The dataset constructed for the purpose of research work, consists of English video scenes transcripts that were collected from the web and were annotated manually as violent and non-violent. Various experiments were performed on the dataset using different machine learning (ML) classifiers with different text preprocessing settings in RapidMiner and Python environments and thus predictive classifier models were constructed and tested. In RapidMiner environment, the SVM classifier model outperformed the other classifiers achieving highest accuracy of 79% after preprocessing step of removal of stop words. In Python programming environment, NB classifier outperformed the other classifiers in majority of experiments with different preprocessing settings, achieving highest accuracy of 82.5%, when stemming was performed in preprocessing stage along with other preprocessing steps. The automatic process of aggression detection in video scenes can be used by concerned authorities to enforce their cultural priorities.",0

As a matter of fact, customer relationship management processes and systems are ever more popular and crucial to facing today's business challenges. However, the large number of available customer communication stimuli coming from different (direct and indirect) channels, require automatic language processing techniques to help filter and qualify such stimuli, determine priorities, facilitate the routing of requests and reduce the response times. In this scenario, sentiment analysis plays an important role in measuring customer satisfaction, tracking consumer opinion, interacting with consumers and building customer loyalty. The research described in this paper proposes an approach based on Hierarchical Attention Networks for detecting the sentiment polarity of customer communications. Unlike other existing approaches, after initial training, the defined model can improve over time during system operation using the feedback provided by CRM operators thanks to an integrated incremental learning mechanism. The paper also describes the developed prototype as well as the dataset used for training the model which includes over 30.000 annotated items. The results of two experiments aimed at measuring classifier performance and validating the retraining mechanism are also presented and discussed. In particular, the classifier accuracy turned out to be better than that of other algorithms for the supported languages (macro-averaged f1-score of 0.89 and 0.79 for Italian and English respectively) and the retraining mechanism was able to improve the classification accuracy on new samples without degrading the overall system performance.",1

With the advances in Information Technology, customer data comes not only from surveys and focus groups but also from social media and networking sites. Few studies have focused on developing algorithms that are devised exclusively to help to understand customer needs from big opinion data. Topic mining, aspect-based sentiment analysis and word embedding are some of the techniques adopted to identify CNs from text data. However, most of them do not consider the possibility that part of the customer data analysed is already known by companies. With the aim to continuously enhance company understanding of CNs, this paper presents an autonomous methodology for automatically classifying a set of text data (customer sentences) as referring to known or unknown CN statements by the company. For verification purposes, an example regarding a set of customer answers from an open survey questionnaire regarding the climate system of a car is illustrated. Results indicate that the proposed methodology helps companies to validate and update the customer need database with an average of 90 % precision and 60 % recall.",0

In this study. we provide an in-depth analysis of public stock reviews and their application in stock movement prediction. Specifically, we propose a novel framework which includes the following three key components: time-sensitive and target-aware investment stance detection, expert-based dynamic stance aggregation, and stock movement prediction. We first introduce our stance detection model named MFN, which learns the representation of each review by integrating multi-view textual features and extended knowledge in financial domain to dis-till bullish/bearish investment opinions. Then we show how to identify the validity of each review, and enhance stock movement prediction by incorporating expert-based aggregated opinion signals.

Sentiment analysis is often used to obtain helpful information about a review and classify it into positive or negative sentiment. Our main goal in this paper is to construct sentiment analysis models using different feature extraction (count vectorization, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and feature selection (mutual information gain and Chi-square) techniques on textual movie reviews. We also study the performance of various classification algorithms for constructing sentiment analysis models over several metrics. We obtained the highest accuracy of 90% with TF-IDF Vectorization, Chi2 feature selection, and SVM classification algorithm. We also found that feature selection drastically reduces the train test time for almost all the classification models without severely impacting other performance metrics.",1

Meena; Shruthi, R.",2022,"COMPUTER SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING","Article","Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the intention or emotion behind an article. The subjective information from the context is analyzed by the sentimental analysis of the people's opinion. The data that is analyzed quantifies the reactions or sentiments and reveals the information's contextual polarity. In social behavior, sentiment can be thought of as a latent variable. Measuring and comprehending this behavior could help us to better understand the social issues. Because sentiments are domain specific, sentimental analysis in a specific context is critical in any real-world scenario. Textual sentiment analysis is done in sentence, document level and feature levels. This work introduces a new Information Gain based Feature Selection (IGbFS) algorithm for selecting highly correlated features eliminating irrelevant and redundant ones. Extensive textual sentiment analysis on sentence, document and feature levels are performed by exploiting the proposed Information Gain based Feature Selection algorithm. The analysis is done based on the datasets from Cornell and Kaggle repositories. When compared to existing baseline classifiers, the suggested Information Gain based classifier resulted in an increased accuracy of 96% for document, 97.4% for sentence and 98.5% for feature levels respectively. Also, the proposed method is tested with IMDB, Yelp 2013 and Yelp 2014 datasets. Experimental results for these high dimensional datasets give increased accuracy of 95%, 96% and 98% for the proposed Information Gain based classifier for document, sentence and feature levels respectively compared to existing baseline classifiers.",1

How to analyze and mine these emotional text data has become a hot topic of concern in academia and industry in recent years. The online LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model is used in this paper to train the social hot topic data of professional migrant workers on the same time slice, and the subtopic evolution and intensity are obtained. The topic development is divided into four categories, and the classification model is created using SVM (Support Vector Machine). Instead of decision makers, a virtual human with sensibility and rationality is built using a hierarchical emotional cognitive model to solve multiobjective optimization problems interactively. It analyzes human body structure and emotional signals, and then combines them with visual and physiological signals to create multimodal emotional data. An example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",0

This is as a result of the growing popularity of social media. People share their sentiments and opinions via these social media platforms. Therefore, extracting and analyzing these sentiments is beneficial in many ways, for example, business intelligence. However, despite a large number of studies on extracting and analyzing social media data, only a fraction of these studies focuses on its practical application. In this study, we focus on the use of product reviews for identifying whether the reviews signify the intention of purchase or not. Therefore, we propose a novel lexicon-based approach for the classification of product reviews into those that signify the intention of purchase and those that do not signify the intention of purchase. We evaluated our proposed approach using a benchmark dataset based on accuracy, precision, and recall. The experimental results obtained prove the efficiency of our proposed approach to purchase intention identification.",0

For these reasons, the use of social bots to manipulate information and influence people's opinions is also growing. In this paper, we use a supervised classification model to distinguish bots from legitimate users on Twitter. More specifically, we show the importance of sentiment features in bot-human account detection. Moreover, we evaluate our detection model by testing on Russian bot accounts which are a recent set of social bots that appeared on Twitter to show that these techniques may be easily adapted to work on new, unseen types of social bots.",0

The goal of sentiment analysis centred on improving users' experience by deploying robust techniques that mine opinions and emotions from large corpora. There are several studies on sentiment analysis and opinion mining from textual information; however, the existence of domain-specific words, such as slang, abbreviations and grammatical mistakes further posed serious challenges to existing sentiment analysis methods. In this paper, we focus on the identification of an effective discriminative subset of features that can aid classification of users' opinions from large corpora. This study proposes a hybrid feature-selection framework that is based on the hybridization of filter- and wrapper-based feature selection methods. Correlation feature selection (CFS) is hybridized with Boruta and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify the most discriminative feature subsets for sentiment analysis. Four publicly available datasets for sentiment analysis: Amazon, Yelp, IMDB and Kaggle are considered to evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid feature selection framework. This study evaluates the performance of three classification algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes and Random Forest to ascertain the superiority of the proposed approach. Experimental results across different contexts as depicted by the datasets considered in this study clearly show that CFS combined with Boruta produced promising results, especially when the features selected are passed to Random Forest classifier. Indeed, the proposed hybrid framework provides an effective way of predicting users' opinions and emotions while giving substantial consideration to predictive accuracy. The computing time of the resulting model is shorter as a result of the proposed hybrid feature selection framework.",1

And in the case of movies, the movie reviews can provide an intricate insight into the movie and can help decide whether it is worth spending time on. However, with the growing amount of data in reviews, it is quite prudent to automate the process, saving on time. Sentiment analysis is an important field of study in machine learning that focuses on extracting information of subject from the textual reviews. The area of analysis of sentiments is related closely to natural language processing and text mining. It can successfully be used to determine the attitude of the reviewer in regard to various topics or the overall polarity of the review. In the case of movie reviews, along with giving a rating in numeric to a movie, they can enlighten us on the favorableness or the opposite of a movie quantitatively; a collection of those then gives us a comprehensive qualitative insight on different facets of the movie. Opinion mining from movie reviews can be challenging due to the fact that human language is rather complex, leading to situations where a positive word has a negative connotation and vice versa. In this study, the task of opinion mining from movie reviews has been achieved with the use of neural networks trained on the Movie Review Database issued by Stanford, in conjunction with two big lists of positive and negative words. The trained network managed to achieve a final accuracy of 91%.",1

However, it is difficult for both producers and consumers to effectively analyze and extract relevant opinions from a vast number of online reviews. To overcome this problem, a product ranking method that combines feature-opinion pairs mining and interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy (IVPF) sets was proposed in this study. First, three types of important feature-opinion pairs were clearly defined based on the diversity and complexity of opinion expression forms in Chinese ecommerce reviews. Two deep learning models were then designed to automatically extract the feature-opinion terms and match them into pairs. Afterwards, sentiment analysis techniques were applied to identify sentiment orientation, and the feature-opinion pairs were clustered into groups using K-means clustering algorithm. Meanwhile, considering the confidence level based on the number of online reviews on different products, sentiment value was transformed into interval-value from, including interval membership and non-membership. As the sum of the converted interval membership and non-membership was greater than 1 and their quadratic sum was less than 1, IVPF set was introduced to represent the interval-valued sentiment. Furthermore, based on the interrelationship between product attributes, we proposed an IVPF weighted Heronian mean operator to aggregate the attribute information. Product ranking was then achieved based on the operator and operations under the IVPF information. Finally, a case study was used to verify the feasibility of the proposed method, and comparisons and sensitivity analysis were performed to demonstrate the superiority of our method.

We show that SA of tweets has potential as a real-time barometer of public sentiment towards negotiating outcomes to inform government decision-making. Despite the increasing need for information on collective preferences regarding possible negotiating outcomes, negotiators have been slow to capitalise on BDA. Through SA on a corpus of 13,018,367 tweets on defined Brexit hashtags, we illustrate how SA can provide a platform for decision-makers engaged in international negotiations to grasp collective preferences. We show that BDA and SA can enhance decision-making and strategy in public policy and negotiation contexts of the magnitude of Brexit Our findings indicate that the preferred or least preferred Brexit outcomes could have been inferred by the emotions expressed by Twitter users. We argue that BDA can be a mechanism to map the different options available to decision-makers and bring insights to and inform their decision-making.

In this regard, deep learning methods have attracted a lot of attentions in recent years and various deep learning models have been proven as effective network architectures for the task of sentiment analysis. However, each of them has its potentials and weak points. To eliminate their drawbacks and make optimal use of their benefits, convolutional and recursive neural network are merged into a new robust model in this paper. The proposed model employs recursive neural network due to its tree structure as a substitute of pooling layer in the convolutional network with the aim of capturing long-term dependencies and reducing the loss of local information. The proposed model is validated on Stanford Sentiment Treebank by conducting a series of experiments and empirical results revealed that our model outperforms basic convolutional and recursive neural networks while requires fewer parameters.",0

The abundance of opinionated text on the internet contains suggestions made by users that can be used to improve products. These suggestions are important to multiple stakeholders; as product improvements for businesses or as tips and advice to consumers. Until now, the extraction of suggestions has usually been defined as a problem of classifying sentences into suggestion and non-suggestion classes. No work has attempted to differentiate suggestions on the basis of intended receiver. Extracting these suggestions with respect to the aspects that reviewers are not satisfied with, could be used as a potential solution to improve products. To address these shortcomings, this study proposes a novel task decomposition called Aspect Oriented Suggestion Extraction to identify product improvements. It contains three main subtasks: suggestion classification, beneficiary classification and aspect extraction. The proposed approach proved to be very effective in determining suggestions from non-suggestions, achieving an F-score of 91% with BERT pre-trained language model, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on suggestion mining.

Specifically, the input image is converted into a bag of instances through visual instance generation module, which is composed of a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) and two adaptation layers. Then, a fuzzy c-means routing algorithm is introduced for generating clustered instances as semantic mid-level representation to bridge the instance-to-bag gap. To explore the relationships between clustered instances and bags, we construct an attention based MIL pooling layer for representing bag features. A multi-head mechanism is integrated to form MIL ensembles, which enables to weigh the contribution of each clustered instance in different subspaces for generating more robust bag representation.

This task aims at identifying the opinion that is expressed in a subjective statement. An opinion is a subjective expression describing personal thoughts and feelings. These thoughts and feelings can be assigned with a certain sentiment. The most studied sentiments are positive, negative, and neutral. Since the introduction of attention mechanism in machine learning, sentiment analysis techniques have evolved from recurrent neural networks to transformer models. Transformer-based models are encoder-decoder systems with attention. Attention mechanism has permitted models to consider only relevant parts of a given sequence. Making use of this feature in encoder-decoder architecture has impacted the performance of transformer models in several natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis. A significant number of Arabic transformer-based models have been pretrained recently to perform Arabic sentiment analysis tasks. Most of these models are implemented based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) such as AraBERT, CAMeLBERT, Arabic ALBERT and GigaBERT. Recent studies have confirmed the effectiveness of this type of models in Arabic sentiment analysis. Thus, in this work, two transformer-based models, namely AraBERT and CAMeLBERT have been experimented. Furthermore, an ensemble model has been implemented to achieve more reasonable performance.",1

"15656","Towards Security Awareness of Mobile Applications using Semantic-based Sentiment Analysis","Alzhrani, Ahmed; Alatawi, Abdulmjeed; Alsharari, Bandar; Albalawi, Umar; Mustafa, Mohammed",2022,"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS","Article","With the rapid increase of smartphones and the growing interest in their applications, e.g., Google Play Apps, it becomes necessary to analyze users' reviews whether they are expressed as ratings or comments. This is because recent studies reported that users' reviews could provide us with useful clues and valuable features that can help in understanding the broad opinion about some applications in term of security awareness. Several techniques have been developed for this crucial task and significant progress have been achieved such as Semantic and Sentiment Analysis, Topic Modelling, and Clustering. The majority of the existing methods are mainly based on representing reviews' words in a Bag-Of-Words vector space with String-matched approaches without considering the common polysemy and synonymy problems of words. This is true due to the fact that users who make use of these applications are often from a diverse background and thus, different vocabulary. This paper proposes a new approach to classifying security opinions about applications from users' reviews while considering special features of synonymous and polysemous words. To achieve this task, the proposed model makes use of word embedding, topic modelling, Bi-LSTM, and n-grams approach. For the proposed model, a new dataset is built that contains reviews about 18 popular applications. The application's selection was primarily governed by making the dataset diverse in its domain. The experiment results showed that the proposed ensemble model which combines the prediction of the extracted features, which in turn captures synonymy, polysemy, and dependency of words-is significantly useful, and it achieves better results with an accuracy approaching 90% compared to the use of each technique separately. The model could contribute in preventing mobile users from unsafe applications.",1

Recently, many research studies have focused on sentimental reflection on the views and impressions of people utilising natural language processing and analytical linguistics. Therefore, we have collected corpus from popular Arabic websites that publish articles related to recent security issues, and we provide light weight preprocessing techniques where data is term matrix is transformed. We also present an intensive lexical-driven data analysis with visualised data views, as our topic modelling technique can effectively extract significant topics from all the collected text from different websites. Our experiments validate the k-means clustering algorithm with and without the latent Dirichlet allocation topic modelling method, and we adopted various validation techniques to measure the topic clustering internally and externally. As shown in the experiments' results, our proposed combined method has a high round index rate of 87.2%, with a large number of topics and clusters.",0

Using an interdisciplinary approach, combining legal studies, corpus linguistics and translation studies theories, the study aims to compare the language of some AGs' Opinions, before and after the introduction of changes in the CJEU's linguistic regime relating to the language(s) in which Opinions are normally drafted. The results of the corpus linguistic analysis demonstrate that certain changes in the linguistic and stylistic nature of AGs' Opinions can be observed post-2004. On the one hand, those changes corroborate the study's primary hypothesis that AG Opinions drafted after 2004 in non-mother tongue languages are stylistically simpler and less 'fluent' than those drafted (in AGs' mother tongues) before 2004. On the other hand, the results also indicate that AG Opinions drafted after 2004 in mother tongue languages are similarly becoming stylistically simpler. These results are inherently interesting in terms of Corpus Linguistics research. However, in order to have a value outside of that field, they are best considered as a basis for more nuanced research questions, which can be investigated through interdisciplinary methods taking account of the factors of production of AG Opinions.",0

Sybils in OSNs are often used by attackers for public opinion intervention, topic flow filling, and dissemination of false and malicious messages. Therefore, if the credibility of the Sybil can be analyzed, then the harm of Sybil attacks can be prevented to a certain extent. Based on the analysis of existing Sybil detection research, this paper proposes an end-to-end Sybil detection model based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model that analyzes tweet text content. Considering the problems of the existing datasets, we built a dataset for text content analysis of tweets based on the hot political topic of the 2020 US presidential election. Accordingly, this study used a distilled version of BERT, DistilBERT, as the sentence embedding model, and the double self-normalizing long short-term memory (Double-SN-LSTM) recurrent neural network model as the classification detection model. The final experimental effect was greatly improved compared with the existing analysis methods, and it had a better detection effect for the more concealed Sybils.",0

Previous studies addressed on the prediction of the helpfulness of customer reviews to predict the helpfulness voting results. However, the voting result of an online review is not a constant over time; predicting the voting result based on the analysis of text is not practical. Therefore, we collect the voting results of the same online customer review over time, and observe whether the number of votes will increase or not. We construct a dataset with 10,195 online reviews in six different product categories (Computer Hardware, Drink, Makeup, Pen, Shoes, and Toys) from Amazon.cn with the voting result on the helpfulness of the reviews, and monitor the helpfulness voting in six weeks. Experiments are conducted on the dataset to predict whether the helpfulness voting result of each review will increase or not.

The Influence of Middle-Level Gatekeepers on the Spread of Political Information on Twitter","Hemsley, Jeff",2019,"POLICY AND INTERNET","Article","Twitter allows political candidates to broadcast messages directly to the public, some of which spread virally, potentially reaching new supportive audiences. During the 2014 U.S. gubernatorial election, 74 candidates for State Governor posted 20,580 tweets, of which 10,946 were retweeted almost 140,000 times. By analyzing a collection of tweets posted by gubernatorial candidates that were classified by machine learning into categories of message types, we find that while candidates tend to post tweets that advocate for themselves the most, the public is more likely to retweet attack messages and messages labeled as call-to-action. As measured by number of retweets, call-to-action tweets tend to reach the broadest audience. We also find that middle-level gatekeepers, those with between 1,800 and 26,000 followers, tend to have the most influence over the flow of political information. Since retweets tend to bring new followers, these findings suggest that politicians wishing to grow their audience may benefit from posting more call-to-action and attack messages, and that candidates may wish to find ways to actively enlist the support of middle-level gatekeepers.",0

People use these reviews as valuable free source of knowledge when decide to buy products. Therefore, an accurate automated system for distinguishing useful reviews from non-useful ones is of great importance. This article presents a new model for specifying the usefulness of comments using the textual features extracted from the reviews. Various types of features including emotion-related, linguistic and text-related features, valence, arousal, and dominance (VAD) values, review-length and polarity of comments are exploited in this study. Moreover, two new algorithms are presented: an improved evidential algorithm for emotion recognition, and an algorithm for extracting VAD values for each review. Finally, the usefulness of reviews is predicted using the mentioned features and an improved Dempster-Shafer score fusion algorithm. The proposed method is applied to review datasets of Books and Video Games of Amazon. The results show that combining the features associated with emotions, features of VAD, and text-related features improves the accuracy of predicting the usefulness of reviews. Also, in comparison with the original Dempster-Shafer method, the precision of the improved Dempster-Shafer algorithm for both datasets is 15% and 11% higher, respectively.",0

We refine the generated tags using NLP syntactic rules to make them more informative. Our proposed Tagging Product Review (TPR) system takes into consideration the opinions expressed on the product or its aspects. We also address the problem of tag generation for cold products, which have only a limited number of reviews and that too, with very short content. We use transfer learning to build a tag cloud from popular product reviews and use it to identify good tags from cold product reviews. We evaluate our proposed system using online reviews of twelve products of varying popularity, collected from Amazon.com. Our result demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach at generating relevant tags compared to three popular baseline methods.

This fine-grained analysis holds significant value for businesses and organizations, as it enables them to gain deeper insights into customer opinions and preferences. Although recent research has shown that fine-tuning pre-trained models (PTMs) is more effective for addressing ABSC challenges compared to previous syntax-based methods, there remains room for improvement.

Consequently, these short and straightforward opinions have increasingly proved to be essential sources of information not only for consumers but also for companies, as they represent the consumer's sincere evaluation, free from any kind of bias. In this sense, there should be an interest in the analysis and monitoring of online reviews by companies, as the result of these actions may provide guidelines to readjust their strategy, support decision-making and ensure the satisfaction of their consumers. To generate useful information to assist decision-making and strategies' implementation by retailers in the Municipality of Porto, online reviews from the GoogleMyBusiness platform were organised, classified, and analysed. 9945 online reviews were extracted, directed to 246 retail adaptations of the Municipality of Porto, from 2017 to 2020, which were later classified by the polarity of sentiment (positive, negative, neutral, or mixed). Sentiment analysis was conducted, combined with statistical tests and frequency distribution tables to discover relevant information for retailers. With sentiment analysis, retailers can understand their consumers and their behaviour to adapt their strategies and make the right decisions to ensure their customers' satisfaction. With the results obtained, this study proves that it is possible to extract useful information from online reviews and reveals that it is still an area of little interest for retailers in the Municipality of Porto.",1

In previous work, while attention has been paid to the use of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to encode syntactic dependencies in order to exploit syntactic information, previous models have tended to confuse opinion words from different aspects due to the complexity of language and the diversity of aspects. On the other hand, the effect of word lexicality on aspects' sentiment polarity judgments has not been considered in previous studies. In this paper, we propose lexical attention and aspect-oriented GCN to solve the above problems. First, we construct an aspect-oriented dependency-parsed tree by analyzing and pruning the dependency-parsed tree of the sentence, then use the lexical attention mechanism to focus on the features of the lexical properties that play a key role in determining the sentiment polarity, and finally extract the aspect-oriented lexical weighted features by a GCN. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",1

Thus, to run the online services in better way, some of the machine learning models are utilized, also the machine learning strategy is became a trending field in big data; hence the success of online services or business is based upon the customer reviews. Almost the review contains neutral, positive, and negative sentiment value; Manual classification of sentiment value is a difficult task so that the natural language processing (NLP) scheme is used which is processed using machine learning strategy. Moreover, the part of speech specification for different languages is difficult. To overcome this issue, the current research aims to develop a novel less error pruning-shortest description length (LEP-SDL) for error pruning and ant lion boosting model (ALBM) for opinion specification purpose. Here, the Telugu news review dataset adopted to process the sentiment analysis in NLP. Furthermore, the fitness function of ant lion model in boosting approach improves the accuracy and precision of opinion specification also makes the classification process easier. Thus, to evaluate the competence of the projected model, it is evaluated with recent existing works in terms of accuracy, precision, etc., and achieved better results by obtaining high accuracy and precision of opinion specification.",1

For example, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and News portals allow users to express themselves through comments. However, such platforms are being misused in the name of freedom of speech. Numerous improper messages towards specific persons or communities can be found in them that use abusive, vulgar, hostile, or harsh words. Moreover, bots are also involved in exchanging such messages nowadays. As a result, user experiences are sometimes ruined on social media. Therefore, automatic identification and filtering of such offensive messages is a significant issue for improving user experience. This paper proposes a heterogeneous ensemble-based machine learning (ML) model powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that can classify messages into Threat, Obscenity, Insult, Identity Hate, Toxic, and Severe Toxic categories.

In this paper, we propose AOPSS, a joint learning framework, to explore the AOPE task as semantic segmentation. As in most prior studies, we divide the AOPE task into two subtasks: entity recognition and relation detection. Specifically, AOPSS can synchronously capture task-invariant and task-specific features for the two subtasks without integrating any additional knowledge. Furthermore, we consider the interaction between entity and relation feature representations, which can improve the mutual heuristic effect for the two subtasks.

This opinion paper proposes a classification for the many and varied types of interference with, and abuse of, sexual and reproductive health and rights. It also stresses the need for accurate portrayal of behaviours, however uncomfortable this may be for survivors or perpetrators. There are a range of abuses including denial of access to services, control, pressure, threats, coercion and violence. Violence may consist of neglect, mistreatment, exploitation or sexual assault. Abuses are categorised sociologically, according to micro, meso and macro levels of influence. Many types of behaviour at meso and macro level contain elements of racism. It is concluded that the term reproductive coercion and abuse should refer only to micro level behaviour. Healthcare professionals should ascertain that no practices that could be considered abusive are taking place in their workplace.",0

Traditional sentiment analysis methods mainly focus on predicting the most dominant sentiment category of images while neglecting the sentiment ambiguity problem restricted by various factors such as environment, subjectivity, and cultural background. To tackle this problem, visual sentiment distribution prediction has been put forward to characterize images by distributions over a set of sentiment labels instead of a single distinct label or multiple distinct labels. Nevertheless, existing approaches usually separate feature embedding and distribution prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised visual sentiment distribution prediction model, termed as low-rank regularized multi-view inverse-covariance estimation, in which feature embedding and distribution prediction are jointly performed. Specifically, our proposed model contains two main components: multi-view embedding and inverse-covariance estimation terms. The multi-view embedding term is restricted by low-rank constraints to seek the lowest-rank representation of samples. The inverse-covariance estimation term is restricted by structured sparsity regularization to learn a more reasonable distribution prediction model. We develop an alternative heuristic optimization algorithm to solve the objective function of the proposed model. Experiment results performed on three publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In the literature, document-level sentiment analysis has been majorly dealt with short-sized text only. For large-sized text, document-level sentiment analysis has never been dealt. In this paper, a hybrid framework named as Senti-NSetPSO'' is proposed to analyse large-sized text. Senti-NSetPSO comprises of two classifiers: binary and ternary based on hybridization of particle swarm optimization (PSO) with Neutrosophic Set. This method is suitable to classify large-sized text having more than 25 kb of size. Swarm size generated from large text can give a suitable measurement for implementation of PSO convergence. The proposed approach is trained and tested for large-sized text collected from Blitzer, aclIMDb, Polarity and Subjective Dataset. The proposed method establishes a co-relation between sentiment analysis and Neutrosophic Set. On Blitzer, aclIMDb and Polarity dataset, the model acquires satisfactory accuracy by ternary classifier. The accuracy of ternary classifier of the proposed framework shows significant improvement than review paper classifier present in the literature.",0

Lexicon based approaches plays vital role with respect to the large coverage of terms. The unsupervised machine learning methods rarely takes into account the appearance of emoticons, modifiers, negation terms, general purpose lexicon and domain specific lexicon while analyzing the polarity of text. In this paper, the lexicon based approaches plays an active role regarding the aforementioned aspects.

Social media use has been demonstrated to play a role in the low acceptance of vaccines. Objective: The aim of this study is to identify the topics and sentiments in the public COVID-19 vaccine-related discussion on social media and discern the salient changes in topics and sentiments over time to better understand the public perceptions, concerns, and emotions that may influence the achievement of herd immunity goals. Methods: Tweets were downloaded from a large-scale COVID-19 Twitter chatter data set from March 11, 2020, the day the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, to January 31, 2021. We used R software to clean the tweets and retain tweets that contained the keywords vaccination, vaccinations, vaccine, vaccines, immunization, vaccinate, and vaccinated. The final data set included in the analysis consisted of 1,499,421 unique tweets from 583,499 different users. We used R to perform latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling as well as sentiment and emotion analysis using the National Research Council of Canada Emotion Lexicon. Results: Topic modeling of tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines yielded 16 topics, which were grouped into 5 overarching themes. Opinions about vaccination (227,840/1,499,421 tweets, 15.2%) was the most tweeted topic and remained a highly discussed topic during the majority of the period of our examination Vaccine progress around the world became the most discussed topic around August 11, 2020, when Russia approved the world's first COVID-19 vaccine. With the advancement of vaccine administration, the topic of instruction on getting vaccines gradually became more salient and became the most discussed topic after the first week of January 2021. Weekly mean sentiment scores showed that despite fluctuations, the sentiment was increasingly positive in general. Emotion analysis further showed that trust was the most predominant emotion, followed by anticipation, fear, sadness, etc. The trust emotion reached its peak on November 9, 2020, when Pfizer announced that its vaccine is 90% effective. Conclusions: Public COVID-19 vaccine-related discussion on Twitter was largely driven by major events about COVID-19 vaccines and mirrored the active news topics in mainstream media. The discussion also demonstrated a global perspective. The increasingly positive sentiment around COVID-19 vaccines and the dominant emotion of trust shown in the social media discussion may imply higher acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines compared with previous vaccines.",1

Second, we benchmark Transfer Learning (TL) techniques and show that they can be used to train robust fake news classifiers from little data, achieving 91% accuracy on our fake news dataset, reducing the error by 14% compared to established few-shot baselines. Furthermore, lifting ideas from multitask learning, we show that augmenting transformer-based transfer techniques with auxiliary language modeling losses improves their performance by adapting to writing style. Using this, we improve TL performance by 4-6%, achieving an accuracy of 96% on our best model. Lastly, we show that our method generalizes well to different types of news articles, including political news, entertainment news, and opinion articles.",0

They aim to classify the subjective texts by assigning them a polarity label. In this paper, we introduce a novel machine learning framework using auto-encoders network to predict the sentiment polarity label at the word level and the sentence level. Inspired by the dimensionality reduction and the feature extraction capabilities of the auto-encoders, we propose a new model for distributed word vector representation PMI-SA using as input pointwise-mutual-information PMI word vectors. The resulted continuous word vectors are combined to represent a sentence. An unsupervised sentence embedding method, called Contextual Recursive Auto-Encoders CoRAE, is also developed for learning sentence representation. Indeed, CoRAE follows the basic idea of the recursive auto-encoders to deeply compose the vectors of words constituting the sentence, but without relying on any syntactic parse tree. The CoRAE model consists in combining recursively each word with its context words (neighbors' words: previous and next) by considering the word order. A support vector machine classifier with fine-tuning technique is also used to show that our deep compositional representation model CoRAE improves significantly the accuracy of sentiment analysis task. Experimental results demonstrate that CoRAE remarkably outperforms several competitive baseline methods on two databases, namely, Sanders twitter corpus and Facebook comments corpus. The CoRAE model achieves an efficiency of 83.28% with the Facebook dataset and 97.57% with the Sanders dataset.",0

Since students are usually unable to visit each HEIs before making their decision, they are strongly influenced by what is written by former international students (IS) on the internet. HEIs also benefit from such information online. The purpose of this paper is to provide an understanding of the drivers of HEIs success online. Design/methodology/approach Due to the increasing amount of information published online, HEIs have to use automatic techniques to search for patterns instead of analysing such information manually. The present paper uses text mining (TM) and sentiment analysis (SA) to study online reviews of IS about their HEIs. The paper studied 1938 reviews from 65 different business schools with Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business accreditation. Findings Results show that HEIs may become more attractive online if they financially support students cost of living, provide courses in English, and promote an international environment. Research limitations/implications Despite the use of a major platform with a broad number of reviews from students around the world, other sources focussed on other types of HEIs may have been used to reinforce the findings in the current paper. Originality/value The study pioneers the use of TM and SA to highlight topics and sentiments mentioned in online reviews by students attending HEIs, clarifying how such opinions are correlated with satisfaction. Using such information, HEIs' managers may focus their efforts on promoting international attractiveness of their institutions.",1

In an FFG-funded multidisciplinary project in Austria (based on the KIRAS security research program), the software tool WebLyzard was used for an automated analysis of online news and social media sources (comments on articles, Facebook postings, and Twitter statements) in order to analyze the media representation of pressing societal issues and citizens' perceptions of security. Frequency and sentiment analyses were carried out by two independent observers in parallel to the automated WebLyzard results. Specific articles on selected key topics like technology or Muslims in two major online newspapers in Austria (Der Standard and Kronen Zeitung) were counted, as were user comments, and both were evaluated according to different sentiment categories. The results indicate various weaknesses of the software leading to misinterpretations, and the automated analyses yield substantially different results compared to the sentiment analysis carried out by the two raters, especially for cynical or irrelevant statements. From a social-sciences methodological perspective, the results clearly show that methodology in our discipline should promote theory-based research, should counteract the attraction of superficial analyses of complex social issues, and should emphasize not only the potentials but also the dangers and risks associated with big data.",1

We can analyze individual's emotions through personal text analysis, collect personal texts by region, and analyze regional emotions through regional text analysis. The text collected by the region can be analyzed for the emotions of the region that could not be obtained from the personal text, and for the reason why the region has such an emotions. In this paper, we analyze emotions contained in texts and designed a regional-based emotion analysis system which provides related information based on analysis. The system collects text data by region through Twitter crawling and stores and manages data using HBase in Hadoop. From the collected data, the stem is extracted through Hangul Stemming Algorithm, and the emotional dictionary for the emotional analysis is constructed by using the elastic net regression analysis. Based on the constructed emotion dictionary, emotions of texts in each region are analyzed, and the analyzed results are provided to users through web services. Through this research, it is expected that the emotion of the individual will be classified automatically, and it will be the basis for the creation of various emotion-based services that can generate and provide new information through the emotional analysis.",0

ABSA usually explores supervised inductive learning algorithms, which requires intense human effort for the labeling process. In this paper, we investigate Cross-Domain Transfer Learning approaches, in which aspects already labeled in some domains can be used to support the aspect extraction of another domain where there are no labeled aspects. Existing cross-domain transfer learning approaches learn classifiers from labeled aspects in the source domain and then apply these classifiers in the target domain, Le, two separate stages that may cause inconsistency due to different feature spaces. To overcome this drawback, we present an innovative approach called CD-ALPHN (Cross-Domain Aspect Label Propagation through Heterogeneous Networks). First, we propose a heterogeneous network-based representation that combines different features (labeled aspects, unlabeled aspects, and linguistic features) from source and target domain as nodes in a single network. Second, we propose a label propagation algorithm for aspect extraction from heterogeneous networks, where the linguistic features are used as a bridge for this propagation. Our algorithm is based on a transductive learning process, where we explore both labeled and unlabeled aspects during the label propagation. Experimental results show that the CD-ALPHN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in scenarios where there is a high-level of inconsistency between the source and target domains the most common scenario in real-world applications.",1

Recently, some previous studies tried to analyze consumer preferences based on time series data for products through online customer comments. However, previous studies have not solved the ambiguity of emotions described by customers in online comments. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system (DENFIS) method to model variational consumer preferences through online customer comments. Using the time series data mined by opinion mining method and the attributes of the review products, the DENFIS method is offered to dynamically model consumer preferences. Case studies are used to illustrate the proposed method. According to the average relative error and error variance, the verification test results show that the proposed DENFIS method is superior to other three adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) methods.",1

In the early stages, individuals practiced writing mode for this motive. But gradually accounting the headway made by technology the channel broadened from text to other diverse modes to convey their opinions like images, audio, video. These means were well received and prevailed so far. Because simple movements of face and pictures convey treasure of information. The voice tune changes along with the change in opinion. Thus these mediums are more descriptive than text. These feelings and conceptions exhibit their sentiments which shape the public opinion. Opinions are usually based on knowledge or experience. It is more concrete whereas Sentiments are feelings one feels about something. An Opinion is composed of Sentiment(s). A particular or group of sentiments leads to a concrete Opinion. Though these two terms are used interchangeably, these two terms are very close but slightly differ in their meanings. People express their held sentiments about an entity socially. A general opinion can be derived or extracted from these sentiments. These Sentiments collectively shape a particular Opinion like positive, negative or neutral which in turn impact and aids other customers, traders, or society in deciding their deals. Additionally, many trends keep recreating dynamically. With this rate of advancement, people keep refreshing their approaches and practices. Hence their sentiments. Thus, these sentiments propagate to others via social media. In the meantime, the pertinent authority can adapt to these changes before the change signals the call and grow wider every day and thus stay connected with customers. Apart from customers, they must be knowledgeable globally with surfacing trends and challenges, new needs and envision the demands. Accordingly, the sentiments circulate swiftly in online system]. But the exiting work on social network sentiment is just to distinguish the sentiment polarity of public opinion i.e., Positive or Negative which can be termed as Bipolarity.

Currently, the people tend to disclose even the socially tabooed topics such as Child Abuse (CA), and Domestic Abuse (DA) to receive the desired response and social support in turn. The increasing volume of abuse related posts being shared on social media is of great interest for public health sectors and family welfare organizations to monitor the public health and promote support services. However, due to the large volume, high velocity and huge variety of context and content of user generated data, it is difficult to mine the different kinds of abuse (CA and DA) related posts from other general posts, that flood over the web. Hence, this paper aims to discover and differentiate the characteristics of CA and DA posts from the massive user generated posts, with the underlying context. Various features such as psycholinguistic, textual and sentimental features are analyzed and Machine Learning techniques are trained to analyze the predictive power of extracted features.

This study examines if the extracted data from Twitter contains valuable insights regarding public attitudes toward vaccines and can be mapped to two behavioral models. This study focuses on the Arab population, and a search was carried out on Twitter using: ’ تلقيحي OR تطعيم OR تطعيمات OR لقاح OR لقاحات’ for two years from January 2020 to January 2022. Then, BERTopicmodeling was applied, and several topics were extracted. Finally, the topics were manually mapped to the factors of the 5C model and HBM. 1,068,466 unique users posted 3,368,258 vaccine-related tweets in Arabic. Topic modeling generated 25 topics, which were mapped to the 15 factors of the 5C model and HBM. Among the users, 32.87%were male, and 18.06% were female. A significant 55.77% of the users were from the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region. Twitter users were more inclined to accept vaccines when they trusted vaccine safety and effectiveness, but vaccine hesitancy increased due to conspiracy theories and misinformation. The association of topics with these theoretical frameworks reveals the availability and diversity of Twitter data that can predict behavioral change toward vaccines. It allows the preparation of timely and effective interventions for vaccination programs compared to traditional methods. © 2023 The Author(s).

Messages concerning any topic are daily posted. A message posted by a given user reaches all the users that decided to follow her/him. Some users post many messages, because they aim at being recognized as influencers, typically on specific topics. How a user can discover influencers concerned with her/his interest? Micro-blog apps and web sites lack a functionality to recommend users with influencers, on the basis of the content of posted messages. In this paper, we envision such a scenario and we identify the problem that constitutes the basic brick for developing a recommender of (possibly influencer) users: training a classification model by exploiting messages labeled with topical classes, so as this model can be used to classify unlabeled messages, to let the hidden topic they talk about emerge. Specifically, the paper reports the investigation activity we performed to demonstrate the suitability of our idea. To perform the investigation, we developed an investigation framework that exploits various patterns for extracting features from within messages (labeled with topical classes) in conjunction with the mostly-used classifiers for text classification problems. By means of the investigation framework, we were able to perform a large pool of experiments, that allowed us to evaluate all the combinations of feature patterns with classifiers. By means of a cost-benefit function called Suitability, that combines accuracy with execution time, we were able to demonstrate that a technique for discovering topics from within messages suitable for the application context is available.",0

Like many other technologies, it brings advantages and disadvantages to communities. Further investigation into public opinion will shed light on the impact of this technology on communities and provide input to city authorities for transportation planning. Transportation planning processes can be enhanced by engaging the community through social media technologies. Social media like Twitter, Facebook, and other microblogging media have been used for planning, but have not been extensively evaluated for that purpose. This study examined approximately 32,000 posts on Twitter to assess public opinion on dockless bike-sharing systems. Using a mix of text mining and statistical techniques, we examined relevant posts to determine the sentiment polarity of tweets, the underlying topics in the tweets, and the extent of engagement and impact on the decision-making process. Results given by two different sentiment algorithms show that there is more positive than negative polarity across the algorithms. Also, the findings show that the underlying topics in tweets include electric scooters, private e-hailing companies, and blockage of sidewalks, among others. The results indicate that the dockless shared mobility models are potentially useful in generating participation, but faced substantial technical, analytical, and communication barriers to influencing decision-making.",1

Recent generative methods such as Seq2Seq models have achieved good performance by formulating the output as a sequence of sentiment tuples. However, the orders between the sentiment tuples do not naturally exist and the generation of the current tuple should not condition on the previous ones. In this paper, we propose Seq2Path to generate sentiment tuples as paths of a tree. A tree can represent 1-to-n relations (e.g., an aspect term may correspond to multiple opinion terms) and the paths of a tree are independent and do not have orders. For training, we treat each path as an independent target, and we calculate the average loss of the ordinary Seq2Seq model over paths. For inference, we apply beam search with constrained decoding. By introducing an additional discriminative token and applying a data augmentation technique, valid paths can be automatically selected.

The availability of online data along with the business interest to keep up with consumer feedback generates a constant demand for online analysis of user-generated content. A key role to this task plays the utilization of domain-specific lexicons of opinion words that enables algorithms to classify short snippets of text into sentiment classes (positive, negative). This process is known as dictionary-based sentiment analysis. The related work tends to solve this lexicon identification problem by either exploiting a corpus and a thesaurus or by manually defining a set of patterns that will extract opinion words. In this work, we propose an unsupervised approach for discovering patterns that will extract domain-specific dictionary. Our approach (DidaxTo) utilizes opinion modifiers, sentiment consistency theories, polarity assignment graphs and pattern similarity metrics. The outcome is compared against lexicons extracted by the state-of-the-art approaches on a sentiment analysis task. Experiments on user reviews coming from a diverse set of products demonstrate the utility of the proposed method. An implementation of the proposed approach in an easy to use application for extracting opinion words from any domain and evaluate their quality is also presented.",1

Given the increasing number of everyday participants in sports in the Republic of Korea, this study aimed to identify sports for all instructor competency requirements and gaps and thus help to develop and foster such instructors' competence. Methods: This study employed big data analysis, specifically, text mining, opinion mining, term frequency-inverse document frequency analysis, and degree centrality analysis. Semantic network analysis was also performed using Textom and UCINET 6's NetDraw program. The data collection period was from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2020. This five-year study was initiated following the reorganization of the sports for all instructor qualification system in the Republic of Korea in 2015. Results: First, eight groups were formed by extracting 80 words with the highest frequency and conducting a convergence of iteration correlation analysis. Second, categorization based on the results yielded four factors: certification of sports for all instructors, coaching competency, competency education, and emotions. Conclusions: The analysis of perceptions of the competencies of sports for all instructors revealed a great deal of interest in a qualification system that can develop competencies and in education that strengthens them. To become an effective sports for all instructor, corresponding competencies are required and a qualification system to acquire and strengthen these competencies is necessary. The state should focus continuous attention and effort on the qualification system to nurture such competencies.",1

Sentiment analysis can be applied to social media data to capture timely information of new events and the corresponding public opinions. However, currently both the social topics and trending words are changing just as rapidly as the target topics and domains that organisations are interested in investigating. Therefore, there is a need for a well-trained sentiment analysis model able to handle out-of-domain input. Current solutions mainly focus on using domain adaptation techniques, but these solutions require domain-specific data and inevitably introduce extra overheads. To tackle this challenge, we propose a green Artificial Intelligence (AI) solution for a sentiment analysis pipeline (GreenSAP) to gain a better understanding of the changing public opinions on social media. Specifically, we propose to leverage the expressively powerful capability of the pre-trained Transformer encoder, and make use of several publicly-available sentiment analysis datasets from various domains and scenarios to develop a pipeline model. A sarcasm detection model is also included to eliminate false positive predictions. In experiments, this model significantly outperforms its competitors on three public benchmark datasets and on two of our labelled out-of-domain datasets for real-world applications.",1

Motivated by this, in this work we examine the potential of transferring knowledge from several pre-trained networks, some of which are out-of-domain. We show that by simply concatenating these diverse feature vectors we construct a rich image representation that can be used to train a classifier with state of the art performance on image sentiment analysis.

Predicting the sign of sentiment links is a fundamental task in many areas such as personal advertising and public opinion analysis. Previous works mainly focus on textual sentiment classification, however, text information can only disclose the tip of the iceberg about users' true opinions, of which the most are unobserved but implied by other sources of information such as social relation and users' profile. To address this problem, in this paper we investigate how to predict possibly existing sentiment links in the presence of heterogeneous information. First, due to the lack of explicit sentiment links in mainstream social networks, we establish a labeled heterogeneous sentiment dataset which consists of users' sentiment relation, social relation and profile knowledge by entity-level sentiment extraction method. Then we propose a novel and flexible end-to-end Signed Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding (SHINE) framework to extract users' latent representations from heterogeneous networks and predict the sign of unobserved sentiment links. SHINE utilizes multiple deep autoencoders to map each user into a low-dimension feature space while preserving the network structure. We demonstrate the superiority of SHINE over state-of-the-art baselines on link prediction and node recommendation in two real-world datasets. The experimental results also prove the efficacy of SHINE in cold start scenario.",1

It might be really difficult for a potential buyer to decide whether to buy a product after analyzing the vast amounts of evaluations. This research introduces a solution for tackling this problem, employing a hierarchical attention network approach. In this proposed framework, the initial step involves preprocessing the Amazon Smartphone Review dataset using natural language processing techniques. Subsequently, the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model is applied to make word vector illustrations of the reviews, capturing their contextual meaning. Developed by Google AI Language, BERT is a deep learning model explicitly designed to pre-train text in an unsupervised manner by considering context from both the left and right directions across all its layers. This is in contrast to previous language representation models that were unidirectional. The pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one output layer for different tasks related to language understanding, such as opinion mining and question answering. This allows efficient adaptation to specific tasks without modifying the model's underlying architecture. Studies show that the suggested framework works better in expressions of accuracy, precision, and recall than the standard methods. Worthy results were attained by the OpExBERT model, including 98.55% accuracy, 91.67% precision, 91.25% recall, and 91.14% f-score. © 2023 Seventh Sense Research Group®",1

For example, identifying and targeting individuals who express ambivalence about e-cigarette use on Twitter may be helpful in devising and focusing public health campaigns to reduce e-cigarette use. This study developed a novel analytic strategy using social network analysis to identify audience segments on Twitter based on positive, negative, and neutral e-cigarette sentiment Using Twitter data collected from April 2015 to March 2016, we identified different sub-groups of users who retweeted about e-cigarettes, and measured each subgroup's clustering coefficient (CC), which describes how tightly people cluster together. Ten high CC and ten low CC groups were randomly selected; then 100 randomly selected tweets from each group were coded for e-cigarette sentiment (positive, negative, neutral). Results indicate that differences in e-cigarette sentiment are associated with clustering of Twitter network ties. Statistical analyses revealed that high CC groups were more likely to have strong e-cigarette sentiments, suggesting that tightly clustered groups may be echo chambers (i.e., like-minded people repeating the same messages). By contrast, low CC groups were more likely to have neutral sentiments, and had greater fluctuation in sentiment over time, suggesting that they may be more flexible in their opinions about e-cigarettes and may be particularly receptive to targeted public health campaigns. Informatics techniques such as determination of clusters using social network analysis can be useful in identifying audience segments for future public health campaigns.",0

ABSA of customer reviews has become a trendy topic because of the profuse information that is shared through these reviews. While SA also known as opinion mining helps to find opinion, ABSA greatly impact business world by converting these reviews to finer form with aspects and opinion or sentiment. These review words are interwoven internally, which depends on the semantics besides syntax, and sometimes there are long dependencies. Recently, the hybrid methods for ABSA are popular, but most of them merely considered if the syntax and long dependency exist, thus missing the inclusion of multi and infrequent aspects. In addition, in most literature, sentiment classification is shown directly without calculating the sentiment scores in ABSA. To this effect, this paper proposes a hybrid with syntax dependency and the lexicon for aspect, sentiment extraction, and polarity classification by Logistic Regression (LR) classifier to overcome the issues in ABSA. The proposed method is able to address the challenges of ABSA in a number of ways. First, it is able to extract multi-word and infrequent aspects by using syntactic dependency information. Second, it is able to calculate sentiment scores, which provides a more nuanced understanding of the overall sentiment expressed towards an aspect. Third, it is able to capture long dependencies between words by using syntactic dependency and semantic information. The proposed hybrid model outperformed the other methods by an average of 8-10 percent with the standard public dataset in terms of accuracy.",1

Social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit and others offer immense opportunities for people to become vocal and participate with their opinions and thoughts on these practical challenges by exchanging information and talking about them. By looking at their attitudes and the issues they discuss, it is possible to determine in this research how users of Reddit, one of the most well-known and popular social media platforms in the world, feel about climate change. Retrieved comments and posts are classified into two sentiment classes: Positive and Negative. To understand the sentiments, we find sentiment targets by comparing two neural networks CNN and RNN and using the more accurate model to predict sentiments of the comments in the test dataset and analyse the nature of climate change discussion over time. Although the computational maximal accuracy for the two models is comparable, it was discovered that the CNN model scored marginally better than the RNN in terms of average precision, average accuracy, and average loss.

Mining online reviews has received extensive attention and efforts. Most existing research on mining online reviews focus on issues such as the impact of reviews on sales, helpfulness of reviews, and customers' participation in reviews. Few research studies, however, seek to identify and extract innovation ideas for products from online reviews. This type of information is particularly important for product functionality improvement and new feature development from a manufacturer's perspective. Mining product innovation ideas allows a manufacturer to proactively review customer opinion and unlock insights about new functionality and features that the market expects, in order to gain a competitive advantage. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach to identify sentences that contain innovation ideas from online reviews. Specifically, we develop a novel ensemble embedding method to generate semantic and contextual representations of the words in review sentences. The resultant representations in each sentence are then used in a long short-term memory (LSTM) model for innovation-sentence identification. Moreover, we adopt a focal loss function in our model to address the class imbalance problem. We validate our approach with a dataset of 10,000 customer reviews from Amazon. Our model achieves an AUC score of 0.91 and an F1 score of 0.89, outperforming a set of state-of-the-art baseline models in the comparison. Our approach can be extended and applied to many other information extraction tasks.",0

Applying SA to the Arabic language presents numerous challenges, including ambiguity, the presence of multiple dialects, a need for additional resources, and morphological variation. The domain of Arabic SA has witnessed significant advancements with the application of deep learning (DL) approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The performance of single DL models has been further improved by hybrid models combining CNNs with bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) or bidirectional gated recurrent units (Bi-GRU). It is anticipated that the accuracy of these DL models can be enhanced through stacked deep learning ensembles. In this study, a stacked ensemble approach is proposed that accurately predicts Arabic sentiment by leveraging the predictive capabilities of CNN, Bi-GRU, Bi-LSTM, and hybrid DL models (CNN-Bi-GRU and CNN-Bi-LSTM). The proposed model's efficacy is evaluated using four extensive datasets: the HARD dataset, the BRAD dataset, the ARD dataset, and a real dataset composed of 71,583 Arabic reviews. Experimental results demonstrate the suitability of the proposed model for analyzing sentiments in Arabic texts. The method's first step involves feature extraction using the AraBERT model. Subsequently, five DL models are developed and trained, including CNN, Bi-GRU, Bi-LSTM, a hybrid CNN-Bi-GRU model, and a hybrid CNNLSTM model. Finally, the outputs of the base classifiers are concatenated using the multilayer perceptron algorithm. Our approach achieves an improved accuracy of 0.9256 compared to basic and hybrid deep learning methods. © 2023, Mathematical Modelling of Engineering Problems. All Rights Reserved.",1

This article concentrates on the mining of readers' social sentiments evoked by social media materials. Existing methods are only applicable to a minority of social media like news portals with emotional voting information, while ignore the emotional contagion between writers and readers. However, incorporating such factors is challenging since the learned hidden variables would be very fuzzy (because of the short and noisy text in social networks). In this paper, we try to solve this problem by introducing a high-order network structure, i.e. communities. We first propose a new generative model called Community-Enhanced Social Sentiment Mining (CESSM), which 1) considers the emotional contagion between writers and readers to capture precise social sentiment, and 2) incorporates network communities to capture coherent topics. We then derive an inference algorithm based on Gibbs sampling. Empirical results show that, CESSM achieves significantly superior performance against the state-of-the-art techniques for text sentiment classification and interestingness in social sentiment mining.",0

In this paper, a Malay sentiment analysis classification model is proposed to improve classification performances based on the semantic orientation and machine learning approaches. First, a total of 2,478 Malay sentiment-lexicon phrases and words are assigned with a synonym and stored with the help of more than one Malay native speaker, and the polarity is manually allotted with a score. In addition, the supervised machine learning approaches and lexicon knowledge method are combined for Malay sentiment classification with evaluating thirteen features. Finally, three individual classifiers and a combined classifier are used to evaluate the classification accuracy. In experimental results, a wide-range of comparative experiments is conducted on a Malay Reviews Corpus (MRC), and it demonstrates that the feature extraction improves the performance of Malay sentiment analysis based on the combined classification. However, the results depend on three factors, the features, the number of features and the classification approach.",1
"15823","The impact of science communication on Twitter: The case of Neil deGrasse Tyson","Denia, Elena",2020,"COMUNICAR","Article","Public perceptions of science have been studied extensively since the mid twentieth century. The aim of this project is to explore the interaction between science and the public in the digital world as a complement to traditional studies on the societal impact of science, particularly on the social network Twitter It thus proposes a low-cost easily reproducible methodology involving the design of an algorithm operating on representative sets of tweets to analyse their content by using computational techniques of data mining and natural language processing. To test this methodology. I analyse the communications of the popular science communicator Neil DeGrasse Tyson. The impact of the information is calculated in terms of 1) likes and retweets; 2) suggested formulas for measuring the popularity and controversial nature of the content; and 3) the semantic network Relevant elements of the communications are then identified and classified according to the categories of science'', culture, political social beliefs, media and emotional. The results reveal that content with an emotional charge in the communicator's message niggers a substantially more profound response from the public, as do references to socio-political issues. Moreover, numerous concepts peripheral to the scientific discussion arouse more interest than the concepts central to the communication, Both these results suggest that science is more interesting when it is linked to other issues.",0

Traditional data sources, such as surveys, provide rich insights into the formation of such attitudes; yet, they are costly and offer limited temporal granularity, providing only a partial understanding of the dynamics of attitudes towards immigrants. Leveraging Twitter data and natural language processing, we propose a framework to measure attitudes towards immigration in online discussions. Grounded in theories of social psychology, the proposed framework enables the classification of users' into profile stances of positive and negative attitudes towards immigrants and characterisation of these profiles quantitatively summarising users' content and temporal stance trends. We use a Twitter sample composed of 36 K users and 160 K tweets discussing the topic in 2017, when the immigrant population in the country recorded an increase by a factor of four from 2010. We found that the negative attitude group of users is smaller than the positive group, and that both attitudes have different distributions of the volume of content. Both types of attitudes show fluctuations over time that seem to be influenced by news events related to immigration. Accounts with negative attitudes use arguments of labour competition and stricter regulation of immigration. In contrast, accounts with positive attitudes reflect arguments in support of immigrants' human and civil rights. The framework and its application can inform policy makers about how people feel about immigration, with possible implications for policy communication and the design of interventions to improve negative attitudes.",1
"16876","Redefining Media Agendas: Topic Problematization in Online Reader Comments","Koltsova, Olessia; Nagornyy, Oleg",2019,"MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION","Article","Media audiences representing a significant portion of the public in any given country may hold opinions on media-generated definitions of social problems which differ from those of media professionals. The proliferation of online reader comments not only makes such opinions available but also alters the process of agenda formation and problem definition in the public space. Based on a dataset of 33,877 news items and 258,121 comments from a sample of regional Russian newspapers we investigate readers' perceptions of social problems. We find that the volume of attention paid to issues or topics by the media and the importance of those issues for audiences, as judged by the number of their comments, diverge. Further, while the prevalence of general negative sentiment in comments accompanies such topics as disasters and accidents that are not perceived as social problems, a high level of sentiment polarization in comments does suggest issue problematization. It is also positively related to topic importance for the audience. Thus, instead of finding fixed social problem definitions in the reader comments, we observe the process of problem formation, where different points of view clash. These perceptions are not necessarily those expressed in media texts since the latter are predominantly hard news covering separate events, rather than trends or issues. As our research suggests, problematization emerges from readers' background knowledge, external experience, or values.",1

The decision-makers in the organizations use social media to engage with their customers since public users tend to express their opinions about certain products and services through this popular mechanism. Hence, this valuable data can be useful for marketing and business decisions. However, the main obstacle is obtaining meaningful information from these platforms due to the unstructured data they present. Sentiment analysis is seen as the best tool to analyze insights or opinions in this huge amount of data. In this article, we extract data on public opinion about property in order to understand the reason behind the imbalances of supply and demand currently faced by the property industry in Malaysia. In addition, we visualized the sentiment results in the form of a dashboard so that it may help property players to understand the public sentiments toward their housing or construction projects.",1

However, the quantitative part is the most complicated to solve because of it is statistical information. This research proposes a method to construct the quantitative part of a Bayesian Network based on text mining and ontologies for Intelligent Tutoring Systems. The network structure is built based on the variables and relations of an ontology. Conditional Probability Tables (CPT) are created from Wikipedia information. The constructed CPT reach a correlation of 0.895 against the experts' opinion. This correlation is good due to the subjectivity in the evaluations. We conclude that using the text mining in Wikipedia and ontologies, it is possible to construct CPT that adequately represents knowledge in an educative environment.",0

Twitter social media platform currently more than 500 million tweets sent each day which is equal to 5787 tweets per second. Therefore, it is hard to track users' overall opinions on the topics contained in social media. To catch up with the feedback on online learning, it is crucial to detect the topic being discussed and classify users' sentiments towards those topics. Even though there are many approaches in developing sentiment analysis models, DL models prove to provide the best performance in the sentiment analysis field. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are two mainstream models in DL used for sentiment analysis classification. Therefore, we evaluate CNN, LSTM, and its hybrids to classify sentiment or an online learning tweet from 2020 until 2021 of 23168 tweets. CNN-LSTM, LSTM-CNN, Bidirectional LSTM, CNN-Bidirectional LSTM models were designed and evaluated based on random hyper-parameter tuning. We explain the proposed methodology and model design illustration. The outcome assesses the superiority of all models with a remarkable improvement of accuracy and a reduction loss when applying the random oversampling technique. Specifically, the LSTM-CNN model with random oversampling technique outperformed the other six models with an accuracy of 87.40% and loss value of 0.3432. However, the computational time has resulted increased when with random oversampling technique. Thus, in the future, the performance can be improved on computational time and hyperparameter selection with the employment of nature-inspired computing for fast and optimal results.",1

Automatically detecting these aspects can be useful for both users and downstream opinion mining applications. Current supervised approaches for learning aspect classifiers require many fine-grained aspect labels, which are labor-intensive to obtain. And, unfortunately, unsupervised topic models often fail to capture the aspects of interest. In this work, we consider weakly supervised approaches for training aspect classifiers that only require the user to provide a small set of seed words (i.e., weakly positive indicators) for the aspects of interest. First, we show that current weakly supervised approaches do not effectively leverage the predictive power of seed words for aspect detection. Next, we propose a student-teacher approach that effectively leverages seed words in a bag-of-words classifier (teacher); in turn, we use the teacher to train a second model (student) that is potentially more powerful (e.g., a neural network that uses pre-trained word embeddings). Finally, we show that iterative co-training can be used to cope with noisy seed words, leading to both improved teacher and student models. Our proposed approach consistently outperforms previous weakly supervised approaches (by 14.1 absolute F1 points on average) in six different domains of product reviews and six multilingual datasets of restaurant reviews.",0
